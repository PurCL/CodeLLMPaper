## [Instruction tuning for secure code generation](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: He, Jingxuan and Vero, Mark and Krasnopolska, Gabriela and Vechev, Martin
- **Abstract**: Modern language models (LMs) have gained widespread acceptance in everyday and professional contexts, particularly in programming. An essential procedure enabling this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMs' practical utility by training them to follow user instructions and...

## [Symmetry-Preserving Program Representations for Learning Code Semantics](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Pei, Kexin and Li, Weichen and Jin, Qirui and Liu, Shuyang and Geng, Scott and Cavallaro, Lorenzo and Yang, Junfeng and Jana, Suman
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated program reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural language processing, raising concerns about their generalization and robustness to ...
