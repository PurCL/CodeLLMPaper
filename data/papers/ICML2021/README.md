## [How could neural networks understand programs?](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Peng, Dinglan and Zheng, Shuxin and Li, Yatao and Ke, Guolin and He, Di and Liu, Tie-Yan
- **Abstract**: Semantic understanding of programs is a fundamental problem for programming language processing (PLP). Recent works that learn representations of code based on pre-training techniques in NLP have pushed the frontiers in this direction. However, the semantics of PL and NL have essential differences. ...

## [Programl: A graph-based program representation for data flow analysis and compiler optimizations](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Cummins, Chris and Fisches, Zacharias V and Ben-Nun, Tal and Hoefler, Torsten and Oâ€™Boyle, Michael FP and Leather, Hugh
- **Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly seen as a viable approach for building compiler optimization heuristics, but many ML methods cannot replicate even the simplest of the data flow analyses that are critical to making good optimization decisions. We posit that if ML cannot do that, then it is insu...
