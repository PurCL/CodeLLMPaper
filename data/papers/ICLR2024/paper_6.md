# Lemur: Integrating large language models in automated program verification

**Authors**: Wu, Haoze and Barrett, Clark and Narodytska, Nina

**Abstract**:

The demonstrated code-understanding capability of LLMs raises the question of whether they can be used for automated program verification, a task that typically demands high-level abstract reasoning about program properties that is challenging for verification tools. We propose a general methodology to combine the power of LLMs and automated reasoners for automated program verification. We formally describe this methodology as a set of derivation rules and prove its soundness. We instantiate the calculus as a sound automated verification procedure, which led to practical improvements on a set of synthetic and competition benchmarks.
