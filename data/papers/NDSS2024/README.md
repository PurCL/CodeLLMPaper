## [DeGPT: Optimizing Decompiler Output with LLM](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Peiwei Hu and Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing and China) and Ruigang Liang and Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing and China) and Kai Chen and Chinese Academy of Sciences and China)
- **Abstract**: Reverse engineering is essential in malware analysis, vulnerability discovery, etc. Decompilers assist the reverse engineers by lifting the assembly to the high-level programming language, which highly boosts binary comprehension. However, decompilers suffer from problems such as meaningless variabl...

## [Large Language Model guided Protocol Fuzzing](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Ruijie Meng and Singapore) and Martin Mirchev and Marcel BÃ¶hme and Germany and Monash University and Australia) and Abhik Roychoudhury
- **Abstract**: How to find security flaws in a protocol implementation without a machine-readable specification of the protocol? Facing the internet, protocol implementations are particularly security-critical software systems where inputs must adhere to a specific structure and order that is often informally spec...
