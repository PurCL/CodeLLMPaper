## [Vulnerability Detection with Code Language Models: How Far Are We?](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Yangruibo Ding and Yanjun Fu and Omniyyah Ibrahim and Chawin Sitawarin and Xinyun Chen and Basel Alomair and David A. Wagner and Baishakhi Ray and Yizheng Chen
- **Abstract**: In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accurac...

## [LLM-based Resource-Oriented Intention Inference for Static Resource Detection](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Wang, Chong and Liu, Jianan and Peng, Xin and Liu, Yang and Lou, Yiling
- **Abstract**: Resource leaks, caused by resources not being released after acquisition, often lead to performance issues and system crashes. Existing static detection techniques rely on mechanical matching of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and null-checking conditions to find unreleased resources, s...

## [Combining Fine-Tuning and LLM-based Agents for Intuitive Smart Contract Auditing with Justifications](paper_3.md)
- **Authors**: Ma, Wei and Wu, Daoyuan and Sun, Yuqiang and Wang, Tianwen and Liu, Shangqing and Zhang, Jian and Xue, Yue and Liu, Yang
- **Abstract**: Smart contracts are decentralized applications built atop blockchains like Ethereum. Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justi...
