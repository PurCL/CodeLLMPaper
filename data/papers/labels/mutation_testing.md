  - **Abstract**: In mutation testing, the quality of a test suite is evaluated by introducing faults into a program and determining whether the program's tests detect them. Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a "+" with a "-" or removing a function's body. However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a technique where a Large Languag...

- [Large Language Models for Equivalent Mutant Detection: How Far Are We?](../venues/ISSTA2024/paper_23.md), ([ISSTA2024](../venues/ISSTA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Mutation testing is vital for ensuring software quality. However, the presence of equivalent mutants is known to introduce redundant cost and bias issues, hindering the effectiveness of mutation testing in practical use. Although numerous equivalent mutant detection (EMD) techniques have been proposed, they exhibit limitations due to the scarcity of training data and challenges in generalizing to unseen mutants. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in various code...
