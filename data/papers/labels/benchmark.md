We curate the dataset by crawling security issue websites, extracting vulnerability-fixing commits and source codes from the corresponding projects. Our new dataset contains 18,945 vulnerable functions spanning 150 CWEs and 330,492 non-vulnerable functions extracted from 7,514 commits. Our dataset covers 295 more projects than all previous datasets combined.Combining our new dataset with previous datasets, we present an analysis of the...

- [How Far Have We Gone in Vulnerability Detection Using Large Language Models](../venues/arXiv2023/paper_5.md), ([arXiv2023](../venues/arXiv2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: As software becomes increasingly complex and prone to vulnerabilities, automated vulnerability detection is critically important, yet challenging. Given the significant successes of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, there is growing anticipation of their efficacy in vulnerability detection. However, a quantitative understanding of their potential in vulnerability detection is still missing. To bridge this gap, we introduce a comprehensive vulnerability benchmark VulBench. This bench...

- [LLM4Vuln: {A} Unified Evaluation Framework for Decoupling and Enhancing LLMs' Vulnerability Reasoning](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_17.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in various tasks, including vulnerability detection. However, current efforts in this area are preliminary, lacking clarity on whether LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities stem from the models themselves or external aids such as knowledge retrieval and tooling support.This paper aims to isolate LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from other capabilities, such as vulnerability knowledge adoption, context information retrieval, a...

- [Learning to Generate Structured Code Summaries From Hybrid Code Context](../venues/TSE2024/paper_11.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code summarization aims to automatically generate natural language descriptions for code, and has become a rapidly expanding research area in the past decades. Unfortunately, existing approaches mainly focus on the “one-to-one” mapping from methods to short descriptions, which hinders them from becoming practical tools: 1) The program context is ignored, so they have difficulty in predicting labels outside the target method; 2) They are typically trained to generate brief function descriptions w...

- [Self-Constructed Context Decompilation with Fined-grained Alignment Enhancement](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_7.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Decompilation transforms compiled code back into a high-level programming language for analysis when source code is unavailable. Previous work has primarily focused on enhancing decompilation performance by increasing the scale of model parameters or training data for pre-training. Based on the characteristics of the decompilation task, we propose two methods: (1) Without fine-tuning, the Self-Constructed Context Decompilation (sc²dec) method recompiles the LLM’s decompilation results to constru...

- [Towards General Loop Invariant Generation: A Benchmark of Programs with Memory Manipulation](../venues/NeurIPS2024/paper_7.md), ([NeurIPS2024](../venues/NeurIPS2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Program verification is vital for ensuring software reliability, especially in the context of increasingly complex systems. Loop invariants, remaining true before and after each iteration of loops, are crucial for this verification process. Traditional provers and machine learning based methods for generating loop invariants often require expert intervention or extensive labeled data, and typically only handle numerical property verification. These methods struggle with programs involving comple...

- [VULGEN: Realistic Vulnerability Generation Via Pattern Mining and Deep Learning](../venues/ICSE2023/paper_11.md), ([ICSE2023](../venues/ICSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Building new, powerful data-driven defenses against prevalent software vulnerabilities needs sizable, quality vulnerability datasets, so does large-scale benchmarking of existing defense solutions. Automatic data generation would promisingly meet the need, yet there is little work aimed to generate much-needed quality vulnerable samples. Meanwhile, existing similar and adaptable techniques suffer critical limitations for that purpose. In this paper, we present VULGEN, the first injection-based v...

  - **Abstract**: Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have proven to be effective for software vulnerability detection, with a potential for substantial productivity enhancements for detecting vulnerabilities. Current methods mainly focus on detecting single functions (i.e., intra-procedural vulnerabilities), ignoring the more complex inter-procedural vulnerability detection scenarios in practice. For example, developers routinely engage with program analysis to detect vulnerabilities that span multiple functions wi...

  - **Abstract**: In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accuracy, and high duplication rates, leading to unreliable model performance in realistic vulnerability detection scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation methods used with these datasets are not representat...
