  - **Abstract**: Deep Learning (DL) systems have received exponential growth in popularity and have become ubiquitous in our everyday life. Such systems are built on top of popular DL libraries, e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch which provide APIs as building blocks for DL systems. Detecting bugs in these DL libraries is critical for almost all downstream DL systems in ensuring effectiveness/safety for end users. Meanw...
