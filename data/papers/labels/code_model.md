  - **Abstract**: The impressive performance of proprietary LLMs like GPT4 in code generation has led to a trend to replicate these capabilities in open-source models through knowledge distillation (e.g. Code Evol-Instruct). However, these efforts often neglect the crucial aspect of response quality, relying heavily on teacher models for direct response distillation. This paradigm, especially for complex instructions, can degrade the quality of synthesized data, compromising the knowledge distillation process. To...

  - **Abstract**: Inspired by the great potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex coding tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, named Code2API, to automatically perform APIzation for Stack Overflow code snippets. Code2API does not require additional model training or any manual crafting rules and can be easily deployed on personal computers without relying on other external tools. Specifically, Code2API guides the LLMs through well-designed prompts to generate well-formed APIs for ...

- [Automating Code-Related Tasks Through Transformers: The Impact of Pre-Training](../venues/ICSE2023/paper_9.md), ([ICSE2023](../venues/ICSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Transformers have gained popularity in the software engineering (SE) literature. These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them. Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned...

  - **Abstract**: Testing is an integral but often neglected part of the software development process. Classical test generation tools such as EvoSuite generate behavioral test suites by optimizing for coverage, but tend to produce tests that are hard to understand. Language models trained on code can generate code that is highly similar to that written by humans, but current models are trained to generate each file separately, as is standard practice in natural language processing, and thus fail to consider the ...

  - **Abstract**: Learning effective representations of source code is critical for any Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) system. Inspired by natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) like Codex and CodeGen treat code as generic sequences of text and are trained on huge corpora of code data, achieving state of the art performance on several software engineering (SE) tasks. However, valid source code, unlike natural language, follows a strict structure and pattern governed by the un...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models have gained significant popularity and are often provided as a service (i.e., LLMaaS).  Companies like OpenAI and Google provide online APIs of LLMs to allow downstream users to create innovative applications.  Despite its popularity, LLM safety and quality assurance is a well-recognized concern in the real world, requiring extra efforts for testing these LLMs.  Unfortunately, while end-to-end services like ChatGPT have garnered rising attention in terms of testing, the LLM...

  - **Abstract**: Recent years have seen the development of LLM-based code generation. Compared to generating code in a software project, incremental code edits are empirically observed to be more frequent. The emerging code editing approaches usually formulate the problem as generating an edit based on known relevant prior edits and context. However, practical code edits can be more complicated. First, an editing session can include multiple (ir)relevant edits to the code under edit. Second, the inference of the...

  - **Abstract**: Automated code summarization tools allow generating descriptions for code snippets in natural language, which benefits software development and maintenance. Recent studies demonstrate that the quality of generated summaries can be improved by using additional code representations beyond token sequences. The majority of contemporary approaches mainly focus on extracting code syntactic and structural information from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, from the view of macro-structures, it is c...

  - **Abstract**: Since the rise of neural natural-language-to-code models (NL\rightarrowCode) that can generate long expressions and statements rather than a single next-token, one of the major problems has been reliably evaluating their generated output. In this paper, we propose CodeBERTScore: an evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020). Instead of encoding only the generated tokens as in BERTScore, CodeBERTScore also encodes the natural language input preceding the...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast source code have achieved prominent progress in code intelligence. However, existing code LLMs have two main limitations. First, they often adopt a specific architecture (encoder-only or decoder-only) or rely on a unified encoder-decoder network for different downstream tasks, lacking the flexibility to operate in the optimal architecture for a specific task. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of pretraining objectives which might not be rel...

  - **Abstract**: Deep learning-based vulnerability detection has shown great performance and, in some studies, outperformed static analysis tools. However, the highest-performing approaches use token-based transformer models, which are not the most efficient to capture code semantics required for vulnerability detection. Classical program analysis techniques such as dataflow analysis can detect many types of bugs based on their root causes. In this paper, we propose to combine such causal-based vulnerability det...

However, due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge, they may not be optimal in completing code that requires intensive domain knowledge for example completing the library names. Although there are several works that have confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuning techniques to adapt language models for code completion in specific domains. They are limited by the need for constant fine-tuning of the model...

However, such an approach has primarily been applied to natural language tasks, and has not yet been explored for symbolic language tasks with complex structured outputs (e.g., semantic parsing and code generation). In this paper, we propose ...

The reason is that the model may not learn to pay attention to the right correlations/contexts without the help of symbols. We propose a new method to pre-train general code models when symbols are lacking. We observe that in such cases, programs degenerate to something written in a very primitive language. We hence propo...

- [TrojanPuzzle: Covertly Poisoning Code-Suggestion Models](../venues/S&P2024/paper_3.md), ([S&P2024](../venues/S&P2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: With tools like GitHub Copilot, automatic code suggestion is no longer a dream in software engineering. These tools, based on large language models, are typically trained on massive corpora of code mined from unvetted public sources. As a result, these models are susceptible to data poisoning attacks where an adversary manipulates the model’s training by injecting malicious data. Poisoning attacks could be designed to influence the model’s suggestions at run time for chosen contexts, such as ind...

- [Who Wrote this Code? Watermarking for Code Generation](../venues/ACL2024/paper_15.md), ([ACL2024](../venues/ACL2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Since the remarkable generation performance of large language models raised ethical and legal concerns, approaches to detect machine-generated text by embedding watermarks are being developed.However, we discover that the existing works fail to function appropriately in code generation tasks due to the task’s nature of having low entropy.Extending a logit-modifying watermark method, we propose Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), which enhances detection ability and mitigates...

## Code Model Robustness

- [Calibration and Correctness of Language Models for Code](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_20.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Machine learning models are widely used, but can also often be wrong. Users would benefit from a reliable indication of whether a given output from a given model should be trusted, so a rational decision can be made whether to use the output or not. For example, outputs can be associated with a confidence measure; if this confidence measure is strongly associated with likelihood of correctness, then the model is said to be well-calibrated. A well-calibrated confidence measure can serve as a basi...

- [CodeFort: Robust Training for Code Generation Models](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_39.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code generation models are not robust to small perturbations, which often lead to inconsistent and incorrect generations and significantly degrade the performance of these models. Improving the robustness of code generation models is crucial to better user experience when these models are deployed in real-world applications. However, existing efforts have not addressed this issue for code generation models. To fill this gap, we propose CodeFort, a framework to improve the robustness of code gene...

  - **Abstract**: Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software engineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer performance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts). Retraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model updates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can be achieved by two steps: 1) input validation th...

- [Iterative Generation of Adversarial Example for Deep Code Models](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_27.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Deep code models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, making it possible for semantically identical inputs to trigger different responses. Current black-box attack methods typically prioritize the impact of identifiers on the model based on custom importance scores or program context and incrementally replace identifiers to generate adversarial examples. However, these methods often fail to fully leverage feedback from failed attacks to guide subsequent attacks, resulting in problems such as l...

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have received much recent attention due to their human-level accuracy. While existing works mostly focus on either improving accuracy or testing accuracy robustness, the computation efficiency of LLMs, which is of paramount importance due to often vast generation demands and real-time requirements, has surprisingly received little attention. In this article, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-a...

  - **Abstract**: LLM-based vulnerability auditors (e.g., GitHub Copilot) represent a significant advancement in automated code analysis, offering precise detection of security vulnerabilities. This paper explores the potential to circumvent LLM-based vulnerability auditors by diverting their focus, decided by the LLM attention mechanism, away from real vulnerable code segments. In these LLM-based vulnerability auditors, the attention mechanism is supposed to focus on potentially vulnerable code sections to ident...

  - **Abstract**: Knowledge distillation compresses large language models (LLMs) into more compact and efficient versions that achieve similar accuracy on code-related tasks. However, as we demonstrate in this study, compressed models are four times less robust than the original LLMs when evaluated with metamorphic code. They exhibit a $\mathbf{4 4 0 \%}$ higher probability of misclassifying code clones due to minor changes in the code fragment under analysis, such as replacing parameter names with synonyms. To a...

However, they tend to be brittle as slight edits to a prompt could lead to very different generations; these robustness properties, critical for user experience when deployed in real-life applications, are not well understood. Most existing works on robustness in text or code tasks have focused on classification, while robustness in generation tasks is an uncharted area and to date there is no comprehensive benchmark for robustness in ...

  - **Abstract**: Detecting vulnerabilities in binary files is a challenging task in cybersecurity, particularly when source code is unavailable and the compilation process and its parameters are unknown. Existing deep learning-based detection methods often rely on knowing a binary’s specific compilation settings, which may limit their ability to perform well on other types of binaries. In this research, we provide a thorough comparison of assembly representation and LLVM-IR to identify which representation is mo...
