  - **Abstract**: While third-party libraries (TPLs) are extensively reused to enhance productivity during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis (SCA), proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become...

  - **Abstract**: Code Authorship Attribution (CAA) has several applications such as copyright disputes, plagiarism detection and criminal prosecution. Existing studies mainly focused on CAA by proposing machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based techniques. The main limitations of ML-based techniques are (a)...
