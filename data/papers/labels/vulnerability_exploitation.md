- [CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities](../venues/ICML2025/paper_3.md), ([ICML2025](../venues/ICML2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications. This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities invol...

- [Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risks of Language Models](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_33.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have the potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and other researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks a...

- [Evaluating Offensive Security Capabilities of Large Language Models](../venues/Google2024/paper_2.md), ([Google2024](../venues/Google2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: At Project Zero, we constantly seek to expand the scope and effectiveness of our vulnerability research. Though much of our work still relies on traditional methods like manual source code audits and reverse engineering, we're always looking for new approaches....

- [From Naptime to Big Sleep: Using Large Language Models To Catch Vulnerabilities In Real-World Code](../venues/Google2024/paper_1.md), ([Google2024](../venues/Google2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In our previous post, Project Naptime: Evaluating Offensive Security Capabilities of Large Language Models, we introduced our framework for large-language-model-assisted vulnerability research and demonstrated its potential by improving the state-of-the-art performance on Meta's CyberSecEval2 benchmarks. Since then, Naptime has evolved into Big Sleep, a collaboration between Google Project Zero and Google DeepMind....

- [Interactive Tools Substantially Assist LM Agents in Finding Security Vulnerabilities](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_15.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Although language model (LM) agents have demonstrated increased performance in multiple domains, including coding and web-browsing, their success in cybersecurity has been limited. We present EnIGMA, an LM agent for autonomously solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce new tools and interfaces to improve the agent's ability to find and exploit security vulnerabilities, focusing on interactive terminal programs. These novel Interactive Agent Tools enable LM agents, for the first ti...

- [Language agents as hackers: Evaluating cybersecurity skills with capture the flag](../venues/NeurIPS2023/paper_1.md), ([NeurIPS2023](../venues/NeurIPS2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Amidst the advent of language models (LMs) and their wide-ranging capabilities, concerns have been raised about their implications with regards to privacy and security. In particular, the emergence of language agents as a promising aid for automating and augmenting digital work poses immediate questions concerning their misuse as malicious cybersecurity actors. With their exceptional compute efficiency and execution speed relative to human counterparts, language agents may be extremely adept at ...

- [Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_32.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior ...

- [Vulnhuntr: Autonomous AI Finds First 0-Day Vulnerabilities in Wild](../venues/ProtectAI2024/paper_1.md), ([ProtectAI2024](../venues/ProtectAI2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Today, we introduce [Vulnhuntr](https://github.com/protectai/vulnhuntr), a Python static code analyzer that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to find and explain complex, multistep vulnerabilities. Thanks to the capabilities of models like Claude 3.5, AI has now uncovered more than a dozen remotely exploitable 0-day vulnerabilities targeting open-source projects in the AI ecosystem with over 10,000 GitHub stars in just a few hours of running it. These discoveries include full-b...
