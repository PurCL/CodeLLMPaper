- [An Empirical Study on Code Review Activity Prediction and Its Impact in Practice](../venues/FSE2024/paper_10.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: During code reviews, an essential step in software quality assurance, reviewers have the difficult task of understanding and evaluating code changes to validate their quality and prevent introducing faults to the codebase. This is a tedious process where the effort needed is highly dependent on the code submitted, as well as the author’s and the reviewer’s experience, leading to median wait times ...

- [Code Review Automation: Strengths and Weaknesses of the State of the Art](../venues/TSE2024/paper_9.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost. The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques &lt;italic&gt;imitating&lt;/italic&gt; developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code....

- [CodeAgent: Autonomous Communicative Agents for Code Review](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_27.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code review, which aims at ensuring the overall quality and reliability of software, is a cornerstone of software development. Unfortunately, while crucial, Code review is a labor-intensive process that the research community is looking to automate. Existing automated methods rely on single input-output generative models and thus generally struggle to emulate the collaborative nature of code revie...

- [SCPatcher: Mining Crowd Security Discussions to Enrich Secure Coding Practices](../venues/ASE2023/paper_8.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Secure coding practices (SCPs) have been proposed to guide software developers to write code securely to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Yet, they are typically one-sentence principles without detailed specifications, e.g., “Properly free allocated memory upon the completion of functions and at all exit points.”, which makes them difficult to follow in practice, especially for software...

- [Semantic GUI Scene Learning and Video Alignment for Detecting Duplicate Video-based Bug Reports](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_32.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Video-based bug reports are increasingly being used to document bugs for programs centered around a graphical user interface (GUI). However, developing automated techniques to manage video-based reports is challenging as it requires identifying and understanding often nuanced visual patterns that capture key information about a reported bug. In this paper, we aim to overcome these challenges by ad...

- [Understanding Developer-Analyzer Interactions in Code Reviews](../venues/ASE2024/paper_29.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Static code analyzers are now a common part of the codereview process. These automated tools integrate into the code review process by commenting on code changes and suggesting improvements, in the same way as human reviewers. The comments made by static analyzers often trigger a conversation between developers to align on if and how the issue should be fixed. Because developers rarely give feedba...
