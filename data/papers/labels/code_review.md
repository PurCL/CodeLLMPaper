# Code Review

- [An Empirical Study on Code Review Activity Prediction and Its Impact in Practice](../venues/FSE2024/paper_10.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: During code reviews, an essential step in software quality assurance, reviewers have the difficult task of understanding and evaluating code changes to validate their quality and prevent introducing faults to the codebase. This is a tedious process where the effort needed is highly dependent on the ...

- [Code Review Automation: Strengths and Weaknesses of the State of the Art](../venues/TSE2024/paper_9.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost. The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques &lt;italic&gt;imitating&lt;/italic&gt; developers in generative tasks, such as comm...

- [CodeAgent: Autonomous Communicative Agents for Code Review](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_27.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code review, which aims at ensuring the overall quality and reliability of software, is a cornerstone of software development. Unfortunately, while crucial, Code review is a labor-intensive process that the research community is looking to automate. Existing automated methods rely on single input-ou...

- [SCPatcher: Mining Crowd Security Discussions to Enrich Secure Coding Practices](../venues/ASE2023/paper_8.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Secure coding practices (SCPs) have been proposed to guide software developers to write code securely to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Yet, they are typically one-sentence principles without detailed specifications, e.g., â€œProperly free allocated memory upon the completion of functions...

- [Semantic GUI Scene Learning and Video Alignment for Detecting Duplicate Video-based Bug Reports](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_32.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Video-based bug reports are increasingly being used to document bugs for programs centered around a graphical user interface (GUI). However, developing automated techniques to manage video-based reports is challenging as it requires identifying and understanding often nuanced visual patterns that ca...

- [Understanding Developer-Analyzer Interactions in Code Reviews](../venues/ASE2024/paper_29.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Static code analyzers are now a common part of the codereview process. These automated tools integrate into the code review process by commenting on code changes and suggesting improvements, in the same way as human reviewers. The comments made by static analyzers often trigger a conversation betwee...
