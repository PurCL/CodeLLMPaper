  - **Abstract**: Large language models~(LLMs) demonstrate significant potential to revolutionize software engineering (SE) by exhibiting outstanding performance in SE tasks such as code and document generation. However, the high reliability and risk control requirements in software engineering raise concerns about the lack of interpretability of LLMs. To address this concern, we conducted a study to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs and their limitations for code analysis in SE. We break down the abilities neede...

  - **Abstract**: Code models have made significant advancements in code intelligence by encoding knowledge about programming languages. While previous studies have explored the capabilities of these models in learning code syntax, there has been limited investigation on their ability to understand code semantics. Additionally, existing analyses assume that the number of edges between nodes at the abstract syntax tree&nbsp;(AST) is related to syntax distance, and also often require transforming the high-dimension...
