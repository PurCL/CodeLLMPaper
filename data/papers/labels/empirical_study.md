  - **Abstract**: Automated program repair has emerged as a powerful technique to mitigate the impact of software bugs on system reliability and user experience. This paper introduces RepairAgent, the first work to address the program repair challenge through an autonomous agent based on a large language model (LLM). Unlike existing deep learning-based approaches, which prompt a model with a fixed prompt or in a fixed feedback loop, our work treats the LLM as an agent capable of autonomously planning and executin...

  - **Abstract**: Modular programming, which aims to construct the final program by integrating smaller, independent building blocks, has been regarded as a desirable practice in software development. However, with the rise of recent code generation agents built upon large language models (LLMs), a question emerges: is this traditional practice equally effective for these new tools? In this work, we assess the impact of modularity in code generation by introducing a novel metric for its quantitative measurement. ...

- [A Pair Programming Framework for Code Generation via Multi-Plan Exploration and Feedback-Driven Refinement](../venues/ASE2024/paper_21.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on code generation. Although prior studies enhanced LLMs with prompting techniques and code refinement, they still struggle with complex programming problems due to rigid solution plans. In this paper, we draw on pair programming practices to propose PairCoder, a novel LLM-based framework for code generation. PairCoder incorporates two collaborative LLM agents, namely a Navigator agent for high-level planning and a Driver agent fo...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing and generating text and code. However, LLMs have had limited applicability in grounded task-oriented dialogue as they are difficult to steer toward task objectives and fail to handle novel grounding. We present a modular and interpretable grounded dialogue system that addresses these shortcomings by composing LLMs with a symbolic planner and grounded code execution. Our system, consists of a reader and planner: the reader leverages an LLM to conve...

  - **Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-plann...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of program synthesis. However, contemporary LLM-based code completion systems often hallucinate broken code because they lack appropriate code context, particularly when working with definitions that are neither in the training data nor near the cursor.

  - **Abstract**: Modular programming, which aims to construct the final program by integrating smaller, independent building blocks, has been regarded as a desirable practice in software development. However, with the rise of recent code generation agents built upon large language models (LLMs), a question emerges: is this traditional practice equally effective for these new tools? In this work, we assess the impact of modularity in code generation by introducing a novel metric for its quantitative measurement. ...

  - **Abstract**: Code translation tools, namely transpilers, are developed for automatic source-to-source translation. Latest learning-based transpilers have shown impressive enhancement against rule-based counterparts in both translation accuracy and readability, owing to their task-specific pre-training on extensive monolingual corpora. Nevertheless, their current performance still remains unsatisfactory for practical deployment, and the associated training resources are also prohibitively expensive. Large Lan...

  - **Abstract**: Unit testing plays an essential role in detecting bugs in functionally-discrete program units (e.g., methods). Manually writing high-quality unit tests is time-consuming and laborious. Although the traditional techniques are able to generate tests with reasonable coverage, they are shown to exhibit low readability and still cannot be directly adopted by developers in practice. Recent work has shown the large potential of large language models (LLMs) in unit test generation. By being pre-trained ...

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely used for code generation. Due to the complexity and opacity of LLMs, little is known about how these models generate code. We made the first attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating whether LLMs attend to the same parts of a task description as human programmers during code generation. An analysis of six LLMs, including GPT-4, on two popular code generation benchmarks revealed a consistent misalignment between LLMs' and programm...

  - **Abstract**: Defect reduction planning plays a vital role in enhancing software quality and minimizing software maintenance costs. By training a black box machine learning model and “explaining” its predictions, explainable AI for software engineering aims to identify the code characteristics that impact maintenance risks. However, post-hoc explanations do not always faithfully reflect what the original model computes. In this paper, we introduce CounterACT, a Counterfactual ACTion rule mining approach that ...

  - **Abstract**: Contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a high degree of code generation and comprehension capability. A particularly promising area is their ability to interpret code modules from unfamiliar libraries for solving user-instructed tasks. Recent work has shown that large proprietary LLMs can learn novel library usage in-context from demonstrations. These results raise several open questions: whether demonstrations of library usage is required, whether smaller (and more open) models also ...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automating significant aspects of coding by producing natural code from informal natural language (NL) intent. However, given NL is informal, it does not lend easily to checking that the generated code correctly satisfies the user intent. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive workflow &lt;sc&gt;TiCoder&lt;/sc&gt; for guided intent clarification (i.e., partial formalization) through tests to support the generation of more accurate...

However, LLMs have had limited applicability in grounded task-oriented dialogue as they are difficult to steer toward task objectives and fail to handle novel grounding. We present a modular and interpretable grounded dialogue system that addresses these shortcomings by composing LLMs with a symbolic planner and grounded code execution.

These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them.

  - **Abstract**: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality code has drawn increasing attention in the software testing community. However, existing code LLMs often demonstrate unsatisfactory capabilities in generating accurate, complete tests since they were trained on code snippets collected without differentiating between code for testing and for other purposes. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, UniTSyn, which can enhance LLMs for Unit Test Synthesis. A...
