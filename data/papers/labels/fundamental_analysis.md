- [A Learning-Based Approach to Static Program Slicing](../venues/OOPSLA2024/paper_7.md), ([OOPSLA2024](../venues/OOPSLA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Traditional program slicing techniques are crucial for early bug detection and manual/automated debugging of online code snippets. Nevertheless, their inability to handle incomplete code hinders their real-world applicability in such scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we present NS-Slicer, a n...

- [Function Argument Nullability Using an LLM](../venues/Galois2024/paper_1.md), ([Galois2024](../venues/Galois2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: We think that Rust is a great language, and maybe you agree! Unfortunately, even if you do, there’s a good chance whatever application you’re working on is written in some older language such as C. To help with this, Galois has been developing c2rust, an automated transpiler (source-to-source transl...

- [Programl: A graph-based program representation for data flow analysis and compiler optimizations](../venues/ICML2021/paper_2.md), ([ICML2021](../venues/ICML2021/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly seen as a viable approach for building compiler optimization heuristics, but many ML methods cannot replicate even the simplest of the data flow analyses that are critical to making good optimization decisions. We posit that if ML cannot do that, then it is insu...

  - **Abstract**: Dataflow graphs (DFGs) capture definitions (defs) and uses across program blocks, which is a fundamental program representation for program analysis, testing and maintenance. However, dynamically typed programming languages like Python present implicit dataflow issues that make it challenging to det...
