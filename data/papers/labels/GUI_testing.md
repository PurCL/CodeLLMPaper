  - **Abstract**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their integration into automated mobile GUI testing has emerged as a promising research direction. However, existing LLM-based testing approaches face significant challenges, including time inefficiency and high costs due to constant LLM querying. To address these issues, this paper introduces LLMDroid, a novel testing framework designed to enhance existing automated mobile GUI testing tools by leveraging LLMs more efficiently. The work...
