- [Tratto: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Deriving Axiomatic Test Oracles](../venues/ISSTA2025/paper_28.md), ([ISSTA2025](../venues/ISSTA2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: This paper presents Tratto, a neuro-symbolic approach that generates assertions (boolean expressions) that can serve as axiomatic oracles, from source code and documentation. The symbolic module of Tratto takes advantage of the grammar of the programming language, the unit under test, and the context of the unit (its class and available APIs) to restrict the search space of the tokens that can be successfully used to generate valid oracles. The neural module of Tratto uses transformers fine-tune...

- [You Name It, I Run It: An LLM Agent to Execute Tests of Arbitrary Projects](../venues/ISSTA2025/paper_1.md), ([ISSTA2025](../venues/ISSTA2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The ability to execute the test suite of a project is essential in many scenarios, e.g., to assess code quality and code coverage, to validate code changes made by developers or automated tools, and to ensure compatibility with dependencies. Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it dif...

- [exLong: Generating Exceptional Behavior Tests with Large Language Models](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_51.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Many popular programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, support exceptions. Exceptions are thrown during program execution if an unwanted event happens, e.g., a method is invoked with an illegal argument value. Software developers write exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) to check that their code detects unwanted events and throws appropriate exceptions. Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their effort...
