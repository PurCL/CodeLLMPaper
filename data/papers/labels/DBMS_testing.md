  - **Abstract**: Effective DBMS fuzzing relies on high-quality initial seeds, which serve as the starting point for mutation. These initial seeds should incorporate various DBMS features to explore the state space thoroughly. While built-in test cases are typically used as initial seeds, many DBMSs lack comprehensiv...
