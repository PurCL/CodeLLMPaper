- [Nuances are the Key: Unlocking ChatGPT to Find Failure-Inducing Tests with Differential Prompting](../venues/ASE2023/paper_7.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated detection of software failures is an important but challenging software engineering task. It involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing test cases that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to stud...
