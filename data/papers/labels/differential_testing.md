# Differential Testing

- [Nuances are the Key: Unlocking ChatGPT to Find Failure-Inducing Tests with Differential Prompting](../venues/ASE2023/paper_7.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated detection of software failures is an important but challenging software engineering task. It involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing test cases that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to study how far this outstanding challenge can be solved by recent advances in large language models (LLMs...
