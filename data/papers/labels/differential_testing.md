  - **Abstract**: Code documentation can, if written precisely, help developers better understand the code they accompany. However, unlike code, code documentation cannot be automatically verified via execution, potentially leading to inconsistencies between documentation and the actual behavior. While such inconsistencies can harmful for developerâ€™s understanding of the code, checking and finding them remains a costly task due to the involvement of human engineers. This paper proposes METAMON, which uses an exis...

- [Nuances are the Key: Unlocking ChatGPT to Find Failure-Inducing Tests with Differential Prompting](../venues/ASE2023/paper_7.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated detection of software failures is an important but challenging software engineering task. It involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing test cases that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to study how far this outstanding challenge can be solved by recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However, our study reveals that ChatGPT has a relatively low success rate (28.8%)...
