# Documentation Generation

- [Cell2Doc: ML Pipeline for Generating Documentation in Computational Notebooks](../venues/ASE2023/paper_17.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Computational notebooks have become the go-to way for solving data-science problems. While they are designed to combine code and documentation, prior work shows that documentation is largely ignored by the developers because of the manual effort. Automated documentation generation can help, but existing techniques fail to capture algorithmic details and developers often end up editing the generated text to provide more explanation and sub-steps. This paper proposes a novel machine-learning pipel...

- [Evaluating Transfer Learning for Simplifying GitHub READMEs](../venues/FSE2023/paper_13.md), ([FSE2023](../venues/FSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Software documentation captures detailed knowledge about a software product, e.g., code, technologies, and design. It plays an important role in the coordination of development teams and in conveying ideas to various stakeholders. However, software documentation can be hard to comprehend if it is written with jargon and complicated sentence structure. In this study, we explored the potential of text simplification techniques in the domain of software engineering to automatically simplify GitHub ...
