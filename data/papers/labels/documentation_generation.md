- [Cell2Doc: ML Pipeline for Generating Documentation in Computational Notebooks](../venues/ASE2023/paper_17.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Computational notebooks have become the go-to way for solving data-science problems. While they are designed to combine code and documentation, prior work shows that documentation is largely ignored by the developers because of the manual effort. Automated documentation generation can help, but existing techniques fail to capture algorithmic details and developers often end up editing the generated text to provide more explanation and sub-steps. This paper proposes a novel machine-learning pipel...

- [Evaluating Transfer Learning for Simplifying GitHub READMEs](../venues/FSE2023/paper_13.md), ([FSE2023](../venues/FSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Software documentation captures detailed knowledge about a software product, e.g., code, technologies, and design. It plays an important role in the coordination of development teams and in conveying ideas to various stakeholders. However, software documentation can be hard to comprehend if it is written with jargon and complicated sentence structure. In this study, we explored the potential of text simplification techniques in the domain of software engineering to automatically simplify GitHub ...

- [SmartNote: An LLM-Powered, Personalised Release Note Generator That Just Works](../venues/FSE2025/paper_22.md), ([FSE2025](../venues/FSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The release note is a crucial document outlining changes in new software versions. It plays a key role in helping stakeholders recognise important changes and understand the implications behind them. Despite this fact, many developers view the process of writing software release notes as a tedious and dreadful task. Consequently, numerous tools (e.g., DeepRelease and Conventional Changelog) have been developed by researchers and practitioners to automate the generation of software release notes....

- [VerLog: Enhancing Release Note Generation for Android Apps using Large Language Models](../venues/ISSTA2025/paper_29.md), ([ISSTA2025](../venues/ISSTA2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Release notes are essential documents that communicate the details of software updates to users and developers, yet their generation remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this paper, we present VerLog, a novel technique that enhances the generation of software release notes using Large Language Models (LLMs). VerLog leverages few-shot in-context learning with adaptive prompting to facilitate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to accurately interpret and docume...
