  - **Abstract**: Code documentation can, if written precisely, help developers better understand the code they accompany. However, unlike code, code documentation cannot be automatically verified via execution, potentially leading to inconsistencies between documentation and the actual behavior. While such inconsistencies can harmful for developerâ€™s understanding of the code, checking and finding them remains a costly task due to the involvement of human engineers. This paper proposes METAMON, which uses an exis...

  - **Abstract**: Automated detection of software failures is an important but challenging software engineering task. It involves finding in a vast search space the failure-inducing test cases that contain an input triggering the software fault and an oracle asserting the incorrect execution. We are motivated to study how far this outstanding challenge can be solved by recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However, our study reveals that ChatGPT has a relatively low success rate (28.8%)...

## Debugging

- [A Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation of LLM-Based Explainable Fault Localization](../venues/FSE2024/paper_5.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Fault Localization (FL), in which a developer seeks to identify which part of the code is malfunctioning and needs to be fixed, is a recurring challenge in debugging. To reduce developer burden, many automated FL techniques have been proposed. However, prior work has noted that existing techniques fail to provide rationales for the suggested locations, hindering developer adoption of these techniques. With this in mind, we propose AutoFL, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based FL technique that gene...

- [Effective Large Language Model Debugging with Best-first Tree Search](../venues/NVDIA2024/paper_1.md), ([NVDIA2024](../venues/NVDIA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in code generation tasks. However, their code-writing abilities are often limited in scope: while they can successfully implement simple functions, they struggle with more complex tasks. A fundamental difference with how an LLM writes code, compared to a human programmer, is that it cannot consistently spot and fix bugs. Debugging is a crucial skill for programmers and it enables iterative code refinement towards a correct implementation. In this work, w...

  - **Abstract**: Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance. However, current LLMs often give away solutions directly, making them ineffective instructors. We tackle this issue in the code debugging domain with TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent guided by a novel state space-based planning algorithm. TreeInstruct ask...

  - **Abstract**: Compiler bugs pose a significant threat to safety-critical applications, and promptly as well as effectively isolating these bugs is crucial for assuring the quality of compilers. However, the limited availability of debugging information on reported bugs complicates the compiler bug isolation task. Existing compiler bug isolation approaches convert the problem into a test program mutation problem, but they are still limited by ineffective mutation strategies or high human effort requirements. D...

- [LPR: Large Language Models-Aided Program Reduction](../venues/ISSTA2024/paper_5.md), ([ISSTA2024](../venues/ISSTA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Program reduction is a widely used technique to facilitate debugging                compilers by automatically minimizing programs that trigger                compiler bugs. Existing program reduction techniques are either                generic to a wide range of languages (such as Perses and Vulcan)                or specifically optimized for one certain language by exploiting                language-specific knowledge (e.g., C-Reduce). However, synergistically                combining both g...

- [Large Language Models for Test-Free Fault Localization](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_3.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Fault Localization (FL) aims to automatically localize buggy lines of code, a key first step in many manual and automatic debugging tasks. Previous FL techniques assume the provision of input tests, and often require extensive program analysis, program instrumentation, or data preprocessing. Prior work on deep learning for APR struggles to learn from small datasets and produces limited results on real-world programs. Inspired by the ability of large language models (LLMs) of code to adapt to new...

  - **Abstract**: Program slicing, the process of extracting program statements that influence values at a designated location (known as the slicing criterion), is helpful in both manual and automated debugging. However, such slicing techniques prove ineffective in scenarios where executing specific inputs is prohibitively expensive, or even impossible, as with partial code. In this paper, we introduce ND-Slicer, a predictive slicing methodology that caters to specific executions based on a particular input, over...

  - **Abstract**: Code executability plays a vital role in software debugging and testing (e.g., detecting runtime exceptions or assertion violations). However, code execution, especially partial or arbitrary code execution, is a non-trivial task due to missing definitions and complex third-party dependencies. To make partial code (such as code snippets posted on the web or code fragments deep inside complex software projects) executable, the existing study has proposed a machine learning model to predict the und...

  - **Abstract**: Automated Program Repair (APR) holds the promise of alleviating the burden of debugging and fixing software bugs. Despite this, developers still need to manually inspect each patch to confirm its correctness, which is tedious and time-consuming. This challenge is exacerbated in the presence of plausible patches, which accidentally pass test cases but may not correctly fix the bug. To address this challenge, we propose an interactive approach called iFix to facilitate patch understanding and comp...

  - **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on code generation. However, for complex programming tasks, generating the correct solution in one go becomes challenging, thus some prior works have designed program repair approaches to improve code generation performance. In this work, we propose Self-Debugging, which teaches a large language model to debug its predicted program via few-shot demonstrations. In particular, we demonstrate that Self-Debugging can teach the large l...

## Bug Reproduction

- [Evaluating Diverse Large Language Models for Automatic and General Bug Reproduction](../venues/TSE2024/paper_13.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Bug reproduction is a critical developer activity that is also challenging to automate, as bug reports are often in natural language and thus can be difficult to transform to test cases consistently. As a result, existing techniques mostly focused on crash bugs, which are easier to automatically detect and verify. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using large language models (LLMs), which have been demonstrated to be adept at natural language processing and code generation. By prompti...

  - **Abstract**: Many automated test generation techniques have been developed to aid developers with writing tests. To facilitate full automation, most existing techniques aim to either increase coverage, or generate exploratory inputs. However, existing test generation techniques largely fall short of achieving more semantic objectives, such as generating tests to reproduce a given bug report. Reproducing bugs is nonetheless important, as our empirical study shows that the number of tests added in open source ...

Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior ...
