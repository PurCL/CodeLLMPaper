- [VULGEN: Realistic Vulnerability Generation Via Pattern Mining and Deep Learning](../venues/ICSE2023/paper_11.md), ([ICSE2023](../venues/ICSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Building new, powerful data-driven defenses against prevalent software vulnerabilities needs sizable, quality vulnerability datasets, so does large-scale benchmarking of existing defense solutions. Automatic data generation would promisingly meet the need, yet there is little work aimed to generate ...

- [VulEval: Towards Repository-Level Evaluation of Software Vulnerability Detection](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_11.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have proven to be effective for software vulnerability detection, with a potential for substantial productivity enhancements for detecting vulnerabilities. Current methods mainly focus on detecting single functions (i.e., intra-procedural vulnerabilities), ignoring t...

  - **Abstract**: Deep learning-based vulnerability prediction approaches are proposed to help under-resourced security practitioners to detect vulnerable functions. However, security practitioners still do not know what type of vulnerabilities correspond to a given prediction (aka CWE-ID). Thus, a novel approach to ...

- [Vulnerability Detection with Code Language Models: How Far Are We?](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_1.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accurac...

  - **Abstract**: With the widely usage of open-source software, supply-chain-based vulnerability attacks, including SolarWind and Log4Shell, have posed significant risks to software security. Currently, people rely on vulnerability advisory databases or commercial software bill of materials (SBOM) to defend against ...

  - **Abstract**: Software, while beneficial, poses potential cybersecurity risks due to inherent vulnerabilities. Detecting these vulnerabilities is crucial, and deep learning has shown promise as an effective tool for this task due to its ability to perform well without extensive feature engineering. However, a cha...
