  - **Abstract**: Research in Text-to-SQL conversion has been largely benchmarked against datasets where each text query corresponds to one correct SQL. However, natural language queries over real-life databases frequently involve significant ambiguity about the intended SQL due to overlapping schema names and multiple confusing relationship paths. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel benchmark called AmbiQT with over 3000 examples where each text is interpretable as two plausible SQLs due to lexical and/or str...

- [Towards Greener Yet Powerful Code Generation via Quantization: An Empirical Study](../venues/FSE2023/paper_8.md), ([FSE2023](../venues/FSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: ML-powered code generation aims to assist developers to write code in a more productive manner by intelligently generating code blocks based on natural language prompts. Recently, large pretrained deep learning models have pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive performance. However, the huge number of model parameters poses a significant challenge to their adoption in a typical software development environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size ser...

- [Towards Neural Synthesis for SMT-Assisted Proof-Oriented Programming](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_8.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Proof-oriented programs mix computational content with proofs of program correctness. However, the human effort involved in programming and proving is still substantial, despite the use of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to automate proofs in languages such as F*. Seeking to spur research on using AI to automate the construction of proof-oriented programs, we curate a dataset of 600K lines of open-source F* programs and proofs, including software used in production systems ranging f...

- [Towards Understanding the Characteristics of Code Generation Errors Made by Large Language Models](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_53.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in code generation. However, there remains a limited understanding of code generation errors that LLMs can produce. To bridge the gap, we conducted an in-depth analysis of code generation errors across six representative LLMs on the HumanEval dataset. Specifically, we first employed open coding and thematic analysis to distill a comprehensive taxonomy of code generation errors. We analyzed two dimensions of error character...

- [UICoder: Finetuning Large Language Models to Generate User Interface Code through Automated Feedback](../venues/NAACL2024/paper_5.md), ([NAACL2024](../venues/NAACL2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Many large language models (LLMs) struggle to consistently generate UI code that compiles and produces visually relevant designs. Existing approaches to improve generation rely either on expensive human feedback or distilling a proprietary model. In this paper, we explore the use of automated feedback (compilers and multi-modal models) to guide LLMs to generate high-quality UI code. Our method starts with an existing LLM and iteratively produces improved models by self-generating a large synthet...

  - **Abstract**: Intermediate reasoning or acting steps have successfully improved large language models (LLMs) for handling various downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks.When applying LLMs for code generation, recent works mainly focus on directing the models to articulate intermediate natural-language reasoning steps, as in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and then output code with the natural language or other structured intermediate steps. However, such output is not suitable for code translati...

- [Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs](../venues/NeurIPS2024/paper_4.md), ([NeurIPS2024](../venues/NeurIPS2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are integral to various software workflows. Such languages offer domain-specific optimizations and abstractions that improve code readability and maintainability. However, leveraging these languages requires developers to rewrite existing code using the specific DSL's API. While large language models (LLMs) have shown some success in automatic code transpilation, none of them provide any functional correctness guarantees on the transpiled code. Another approach f...

- [Verified multi-step synthesis using large language models and monte carlo tree search](../venues/NeurIPS2024/paper_3.md), ([NeurIPS2024](../venues/NeurIPS2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: We present an approach using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate verified programs in Dafny, Lean and Coq. Our method, which we call VMCTS, leverages the verifier inside the search algorithm by checking partial programs at each step. In combination with the LLM prior, the verifier feedback raises the synthesis capabilities of open source models. On a set of five verified programming problems, we find that in four problems where the base model cannot s...

- [When to Stop? Towards Efficient Code Generation in LLMs with Excess Token Prevention](../venues/ISSTA2024/paper_12.md), ([ISSTA2024](../venues/ISSTA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets that meet given natural language requirements and plays an important role in software development. Although Code LLMs have shown excellent performance in this domain, their long generation time poses a signification limitation in practice use. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth preliminary study with different Code LLMs on code generation task and identify a significant efficiency issue, i.e., continual generation of excess to...

  - **Abstract**: Since the remarkable generation performance of large language models raised ethical and legal concerns, approaches to detect machine-generated text by embedding watermarks are being developed.However, we discover that the existing works fail to function appropriately in code generation tasks due to the task’s nature of having low entropy.Extending a logit-modifying watermark method, we propose Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), which enhances detection ability and mitigates...
