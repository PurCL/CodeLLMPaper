- [Improving Binary Code Similarity Transformer Models by Semantics-Driven Instruction Deemphasis](../venues/ISSTA2023/paper_5.md), ([ISSTA2023](../venues/ISSTA2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Given a function in the binary executable form, binary code similarity analysis determines a set of similar functions from a large pool of candidate functions. These similar functions are usually compiled from the same source code with different compilation setups. Such analysis has a large number o...
