# Commit Message Generation

- [Automatic Commit Message Generation: A Critical Review and Directions for Future Work](../venues/TSE2024/paper_7.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Commit messages are critical for code comprehension and software maintenance. Writing a high-quality message requires skill and effort. To support developers and reduce their effort on this task, several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate commit messages. Despite the promising p...

  - **Abstract**: Code comment generation aims at generating natural language descriptions for a code snippet to facilitate developers' program comprehension activities. Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while d...

- [Leveraging Context-Aware Prompting for Commit Message Generation](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_30.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Writing comprehensive commit messages is tedious yet important, because these messages describe changes of code, such as fixing bugs or adding new features. However, most existing methods focus on either only the changed lines or nearest context lines, without considering the effectiveness of select...

- [Only diff Is Not Enough: Generating Commit Messages Leveraging Reasoning and Action of Large Language Model](../venues/FSE2024/paper_21.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Commit messages play a vital role in software development and maintenance. While previous research has introduced various Commit Message Generation (CMG) approaches, they often suffer from a lack of consideration for the broader software context associated with code changes. This limitation resulted...
