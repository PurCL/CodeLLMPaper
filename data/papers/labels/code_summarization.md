- [Automatic Semantic Augmentation of Language Model Prompts (for Code Summarization)](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_19.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLM) are a new class of computation engines, "programmed" via prompt engineering. Researchers are still learning how to best "program" these LLMs to help developers. We start with the intuition that developers tend to consciously and unconsciously collect semantics facts, from...

- [CoSS: Leveraging Statement Semantics for Code Summarization](../venues/TSE2023/paper_4.md), ([TSE2023](../venues/TSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated code summarization tools allow generating descriptions for code snippets in natural language, which benefits software development and maintenance. Recent studies demonstrate that the quality of generated summaries can be improved by using additional code representations beyond token sequen...

- [Code Structure–Guided Transformer for Source Code Summarization](../venues/TOSEM2023/paper_3.md), ([TOSEM2023](../venues/TOSEM2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code summaries help developers comprehend programs and reduce their time to infer the program functionalities during software maintenance. Recent efforts resort to deep learning techniques such as sequence-to-sequence models for generating accurate code summaries, among which Transformer-based appro...

- [EyeTrans: Merging Human and Machine Attention for Neural Code Summarization](../venues/FSE2024/paper_30.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Neural code summarization leverages deep learning models to automatically generate brief natural language summaries of code snippets. The development of Transformer models has led to extensive use of attention during model design. While existing work has primarily and almost exclusively focused on s...

- [Learning to Generate Structured Code Summaries From Hybrid Code Context](../venues/TSE2024/paper_11.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code summarization aims to automatically generate natural language descriptions for code, and has become a rapidly expanding research area in the past decades. Unfortunately, existing approaches mainly focus on the “one-to-one” mapping from methods to short descriptions, which hinders them from beco...

- [Natural Is the Best: Model-Agnostic Code Simplification for Pre-trained Large Language Models](../venues/FSE2024/paper_17.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable successes in several domains. However, code-oriented LLMs are often heavy in computational complexity, and quadratically with the length of the input code sequence. Toward simplifying the input program of an LLM, the state-of-the-art a...

- [SimLLM: Calculating Semantic Similarity in Code Summaries using a Large Language Model-Based Approach](../venues/FSE2024/paper_4.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code summaries are pivotal in software engineering, serving to improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automatic code summarization, existing metrics for evaluating summary quality, such as BL...

- [Understanding Code Changes Practically with Small-Scale Language Models](../venues/ASE2024/paper_3.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Recent studies indicate that traditional techniques for understanding code changes are not as effective as techniques that directly prompt language models (LMs). However, current LM-based techniques heavily rely on expensive, large LMs (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama-13b, which are either commercial ...
