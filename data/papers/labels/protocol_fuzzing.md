# Protocol Fuzzing

- [Large Language Model guided Protocol Fuzzing](../venues/NDSS2024/paper_2.md), ([NDSS2024](../venues/NDSS2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: How to find security flaws in a protocol implementation without a machine-readable specification of the protocol? Facing the internet, protocol implementations are particularly security-critical software systems where inputs must adhere to a specific structure and order that is often informally specified in hundreds of pages in natural language (RFC). Without some machine-readable version of that protocol, it is difficult to automatically generate valid test inputs for its implementation that fo...
