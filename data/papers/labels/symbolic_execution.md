  - **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, offering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem provers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently probabilistic by nature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy and scale of the analysis in real-world application. Such issues often necessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token l...
