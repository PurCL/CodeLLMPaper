  - **Abstract**: Static program analysis is a popular technique in software engineering. Traditional static analysis algorithms treat programs as sets of logical statements with well-defined semantics. These traditional analyzers can provide guarantees of their performance, such as guaranteeing that they will never miss a bug. However, they leave out lots of very rich information such as variable and field names. Language models for code on the other hand, take full advantage of information such as variable name...

- [Can LLMs Formally Reason as Abstract Interpreters for Program Analysis?](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_16.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension, but their potential in being able to perform program analysis in a formal, automatic manner remains under-explored. To that end, we systematically investigate whether LLMs can reason about programs using a program analysis framework called abstract interpretation. We prompt LLMs to follow two different strategies, denoted as Compositional and Fixed Point Equation, to formally reason in the style of abstract inte...
