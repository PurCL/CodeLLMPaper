## Code Review

- [An Empirical Study on Code Review Activity Prediction and Its Impact in Practice](../venues/FSE2024/paper_10.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: During code reviews, an essential step in software quality assurance, reviewers have the difficult task of understanding and evaluating code changes to validate their quality and prevent introducing faults to the codebase. This is a tedious process where the effort needed is highly dependent on the code submitted, as well as the author’s and the reviewer’s experience, leading to median wait times for review feedback of 15-64 hours. Through an initial user study carried with 29 experts, we found ...

- [Code Review Automation: Strengths and Weaknesses of the State of the Art](../venues/TSE2024/paper_9.md), ([TSE2024](../venues/TSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The automation of code review has been tackled by several researchers with the goal of reducing its cost. The adoption of deep learning in software engineering pushed the automation to new boundaries, with techniques &lt;italic&gt;imitating&lt;/italic&gt; developers in generative tasks, such as commenting on a code change as a reviewer would do or addressing a reviewer's comment by modifying code. The performance of these techniques is usually assessed through quantitative metrics, &lt;italic&gt...

- [CodeAgent: Autonomous Communicative Agents for Code Review](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_26.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Code review, which aims at ensuring the overall quality and reliability of software, is a cornerstone of software development. Unfortunately, while crucial, Code review is a labor-intensive process that the research community is looking to automate. Existing automated methods rely on single input-output generative models and thus generally struggle to emulate the collaborative nature of code review. This work introduces CodeAgent, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system for code re...

- [SCPatcher: Mining Crowd Security Discussions to Enrich Secure Coding Practices](../venues/ASE2023/paper_8.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Secure coding practices (SCPs) have been proposed to guide software developers to write code securely to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Yet, they are typically one-sentence principles without detailed specifications, e.g., “Properly free allocated memory upon the completion of functions and at all exit points.”, which makes them difficult to follow in practice, especially for software developers who are not yet experienced in secure programming. To address this problem, this paper p...

- [Understanding Developer-Analyzer Interactions in Code Reviews](../venues/ASE2024/paper_29.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Static code analyzers are now a common part of the codereview process. These automated tools integrate into the code review process by commenting on code changes and suggesting improvements, in the same way as human reviewers. The comments made by static analyzers often trigger a conversation between developers to align on if and how the issue should be fixed. Because developers rarely give feedback directly to the tool, understanding the sentiment and intent in the conversation triggered by the...

## Documentation Generation

- [Cell2Doc: ML Pipeline for Generating Documentation in Computational Notebooks](../venues/ASE2023/paper_17.md), ([ASE2023](../venues/ASE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Computational notebooks have become the go-to way for solving data-science problems. While they are designed to combine code and documentation, prior work shows that documentation is largely ignored by the developers because of the manual effort. Automated documentation generation can help, but existing techniques fail to capture algorithmic details and developers often end up editing the generated text to provide more explanation and sub-steps. This paper proposes a novel machine-learning pipel...

## Commit Message Generation

- [An Empirical Study on Commit Message Generation Using LLMs via In-Context Learning](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_30.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Commit messages concisely describe code changes in natural language and are important for software maintenance. Several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate commit messages, but they still suffer from critical limitations, such as time-consuming training and poor generalization ability. To tackle these limitations, we propose to borrow the weapon of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL). Our intuition is based on the fact that the training corpora of LLMs ...

  - **Abstract**: Code comment generation aims at generating natural language descriptions for a code snippet to facilitate developers' program comprehension activities. Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developers usually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is the functionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle this limitation, this study empirically investi...

- [Leveraging Context-Aware Prompting for Commit Message Generation](../venues/EMNLP2024/paper_29.md), ([EMNLP2024](../venues/EMNLP2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Writing comprehensive commit messages is tedious yet important, because these messages describe changes of code, such as fixing bugs or adding new features. However, most existing methods focus on either only the changed lines or nearest context lines, without considering the effectiveness of selecting useful contexts. On the other hand, it is possible that introducing excessive contexts can lead to noise. To this end, we propose a code model COMMIT (Context-aware prOMpting based comMIt-message ...

- [Only diff Is Not Enough: Generating Commit Messages Leveraging Reasoning and Action of Large Language Model](../venues/FSE2024/paper_21.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Commit messages play a vital role in software development and maintenance. While previous research has introduced various Commit Message Generation (CMG) approaches, they often suffer from a lack of consideration for the broader software context associated with code changes. This limitation resulted in generated commit messages that contained insufficient information and were poorly readable. To address these shortcomings, we approached CMG as a knowledge-intensive reasoning task. We employed Re...

## Software Configuration

- [Face It Yourselves: An LLM-Based Two-Stage Strategy to Localize Configuration Errors via Logs](../venues/ISSTA2024/paper_1.md), ([ISSTA2024](../venues/ISSTA2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Configurable software systems are prone to configuration errors, resulting in significant losses to companies. However, diagnosing these errors is challenging due to the vast and complex configuration space. These errors pose significant challenges for both experienced maintainers and new end-users, particularly those without access to the source code of the software systems. Given that logs are easily accessible to most end-users, we conduct a preliminary study to outline the challenges and opp...

## System Log Analysis

- [Go Static: Contextualized Logging Statement Generation](../venues/FSE2024/paper_18.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Logging practices have been extensively investigated to assist developers in writing appropriate logging statements for documenting software behaviors. Although numerous automatic logging approaches have been proposed, their performance remains unsatisfactory due to the constraint of the single-method input, without informative programming context outside the method. Specifically, we identify three inherent limitations with single-method context: limited static scope of logging statements, incon...

- [LILAC: Log Parsing using LLMs with Adaptive Parsing Cache](../venues/FSE2024/paper_15.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Log parsing transforms log messages into structured formats, serving as the prerequisite step for various log analysis tasks. Although a variety of log parsing approaches have been proposed, their performance on complicated log data remains compromised due to the use of human-crafted rules or learning-based models with limited training data. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrates their vast pre-trained knowledge related to code and logging, making it promising...

- [Log Parsing with Generalization Ability under New Log Types](../venues/FSE2023/paper_10.md), ([FSE2023](../venues/FSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Log parsing, which converts semi-structured logs into structured logs, is the first step for automated log analysis.  Existing parsers are still unsatisfactory in real-world systems due to new log types in new-coming logs.  In practice, available logs collected during system runtime often do not contain all the possible log types of a system because log types related to infrequently activated system states are unlikely to be recorded and new log types are frequently introduced with system update...

- [UniLog: Automatic Logging via LLM and In-Context Learning](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_1.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Logging, which aims to determine the position of logging statements, the verbosity levels, and the log messages, is a crucial process for software reliability enhancement. In recent years, numerous automatic logging tools have been designed to assist developers in one of the logging tasks (e.g., providing suggestions on whether to log in try-catch blocks). These tools are useful in certain situations yet cannot provide a comprehensive logging solution in general. Moreover, although recent resear...
