- [Automated Program Refinement: Guide and Verify Code Large Language Model with Refinement Calculus](../venues/POPL2025/paper_1.md), ([POPL2025](../venues/POPL2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Recently, the rise of code-centric large language models (LLMs) appears to have reshaped the software engineering world with low-barrier tools like Copilot that can generate code easily. However, there is no correctness guarantee for the code generated by LLMs, which suffer from the hallucination problem, and their output is fraught with risks. Besides, the end-to-end process from specification to code through LLMs is a non-transparent and uncontrolled black box. This opacity makes it difficult ...

- [Baldur: Whole-Proof Generation and Repair with Large Language Models](../venues/FSE2023/paper_3.md), ([FSE2023](../venues/FSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formally verifying software is a highly desirable but labor-intensive task.  Recent work has developed methods to automate formal verification using proof assistants, such as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, e.g., by training a model to predict one proof step at a time and using that model to search through the space of possible proofs.  This paper introduces a new method to automate formal verification: We use large language models, trained on natural language and code and fine-tuned on proofs, to generat...

- [Can ChatGPT support software verification?](../venues/FASE2024/paper_1.md), ([FASE2024](../venues/FASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification....

- [Can large language models reason about program invariants?](../venues/ICML2023/paper_3.md), ([ICML2023](../venues/ICML2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Identifying invariants is an important program analysis task with applications towards program understanding, bug finding, vulnerability analysis, and formal verification. Existing tools for identifying program invariants rely on dynamic analysis, requiring traces collected from multiple executions in order to produce reliable invariants. We study the application of large language models to invariant prediction, finding that models trained on source code and fine-tuned for invariant generation c...

- [ClassInvGen: Class Invariant Synthesis using Large Language Models](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_9.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs. They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier). However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the n...

- [CoqPilot, a plugin for LLM-based generation of proofs](../venues/ASE2024/paper_36.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: We present CoqPilot, a VS Code extension designed to help automate writing of Coq proofs. The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine...

- [Enchanting program specification synthesis by large language models using static analysis and program verification](../venues/CAV2024/paper_1.md), ([CAV2024](../venues/CAV2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formal verification provides a rigorous and systematic approach to ensure the correctness and reliability of software systems. Yet, constructing specifications for the full proof relies on domain expertise and non-trivial manpower. In view of such needs, an automated approach for specification synthesis is desired. While existing automated approaches are limited in their versatility, i.e., they either focus only on synthesizing loop invariants for numerical programs, or are tailored for specific...

- [Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_24.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Auto...

- [Finding inductive loop invariants using large language models](../venues/arXiv2023/paper_11.md), ([arXiv2023](../venues/arXiv2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**:     Loop invariants are fundamental to reasoning about programs with loops. They establish properties about a given loop's behavior. When they additionally are inductive, they become useful for the task of formal verification that seeks to establish strong mathematical guarantees about program's runtime behavior. The inductiveness ensures that the invariants can be checked locally without consulting the entire program, thus are indispensable artifacts in a formal proof of correctness. Finding in...

- [Hypothesis search: Inductive reasoning with language models](../venues/ICLR2024/paper_2.md), ([ICLR2024](../venues/ICLR2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which can then be robustly generalized to novel scenarios. Recent work has evaluated large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding "in context learning." This can work well for straightforward inductive tasks, but performs very poorly on more complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose...

- [LLM Meets Bounded Model Checking: Neuro-symbolic Loop Invariant Inference](../venues/ASE2024/paper_7.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Loop invariant inference, a key component in program verification, is a challenging task due to the inherent undecidability and complex loop behaviors in practice. Recently, machine learning based techniques have demonstrated impressive performance in generating loop invariants automatically. However, these methods highly rely on the labeled training data, and are intrinsically random and uncertain, leading to unstable performance. In this paper, we investigate a synergy of large language models...

- [LLM-Generated Invariants for Bounded Model Checking Without Loop Unrolling](../venues/ASE2024/paper_23.md), ([ASE2024](../venues/ASE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: We investigate a modification of the classical Bounded Model Checking (BMC) procedure that does not handle loops through unrolling but via modifications to the control flow graph (CFG). A portion of the CFG representing a loop is replaced by a node asserting invariants of the loop. We generate these invariants using Large Language Models (LLMs) and use a first-order theorem prover to ensure the correctness of the generated statements. We thus transform programs to loop-free variants in a sound m...

- [Laurel: Unblocking Automated Verification with Large Language Models](../venues/OOPSLA2025/paper_3.md), ([OOPSLA2025](../venues/OOPSLA2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Program verifiers such as Dafny automate proofs by outsourcing them to an SMT solver. This automation is not perfect, however, and the solver often requires hints in the form of assertions, creating a burden for the proof engineer. In this paper, we propose, a tool that alleviates this burden by automatically generating assertions using large language models (LLMs). To improve the success rate of LLMs in this task, we design two domain-specific prompting techniques. First, we help the LLM determ...

- [Lemur: Integrating large language models in automated program verification](../venues/ICLR2024/paper_6.md), ([ICLR2024](../venues/ICLR2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: The demonstrated code-understanding capability of LLMs raises the question of whether they can be used for automated program verification, a task that typically demands high-level abstract reasoning about program properties that is challenging for verification tools. We propose a general methodology to combine the power of LLMs and automated reasoners for automated program verification. We formally describe this methodology as a set of derivation rules and prove its soundness. We instantiate the...

- [PropertyGPT: LLM-driven Formal Verification of Smart Contracts through Retrieval-Augmented Property Generation](../venues/NDSS2025/paper_8.md), ([NDSS2025](../venues/NDSS2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formal verification is a technique that can prove the correctness of a system with respect to a certain specification or property. It is especially valuable for security-sensitive smart contracts that manage billions in cryptocurrency assets. Although existing research has developed various static verification tools (or provers) for smart contracts, a key missing component is theautomated generation of comprehensive properties, including invariants, pre-/post-conditions, and rules. Hence, indust...

- [QEDCartographer: Automating Formal Verification Using Reward-Free Reinforcement Learning](../venues/ICSE2025/paper_3.md), ([ICSE2025](../venues/ICSE2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formal verification is a promising method for producing reliable software, but the difficulty of manually writing verification proofs severely limits its utility in practice. Recent methods have automated some proof synthesis by guiding a search through the proof space using a theorem prover. Unfortunately, the theorem prover provides only the crudest estimate of progress, resulting in effectively undirected search. To address this problem, we create QEDCartographer, an automated proof-synthesis...

- [Ranking llm-generated loop invariants for program verification](../venues/EMNLP2023/paper_13.md), ([EMNLP2023](../venues/EMNLP2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Synthesizing inductive loop invariants is fundamental to automating program verification. In this work, we observe that Large Language Models (such as gpt-3.5 or gpt-4) are capable of synthesizing loop invariants for a class of programs in a 0-shot setting, yet require several samples to generate the correct invariants. This can lead to a large number of calls to a program verifier to establish an invariant. To address this issue, we propose a {\it re-ranking} approach for the generated results ...

- [Towards AI-Assisted Synthesis of Verified Dafny Methods](../venues/FSE2024/paper_23.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models show great promise in many domains, including programming. A promise is easy to make but hard to keep, and language models often fail to keep their promises, generating erroneous code. A promising avenue to keep models honest is to incorporate formal verification: generating programs’ specifications as well as code so that the code can be proved correct with respect to the specifications. Unfortunately, existing large language models show a severe lack of proficiency in ver...

  - **Abstract**: Program verification is vital for ensuring software reliability, especially in the context of increasingly complex systems. Loop invariants, remaining true before and after each iteration of loops, are crucial for this verification process. Traditional provers and machine learning based methods for generating loop invariants often require expert intervention or extensive labeled data, and typically only handle numerical property verification. These methods struggle with programs involving comple...

  - **Abstract**: Rust is a programming language that combines memory safety and low-level control, providing C-like performance while guaranteeing the absence of undefined behaviors by default. Rust's growing popularity has prompted research on safe and correct transpiling of existing code-bases to Rust. Existing work falls into two categories: rule-based and large language model (LLM)-based. While rule-based approaches can theoretically produce correct transpilations that maintain input-output equivalence to th...

  - **Abstract**: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are integral to various software workflows. Such languages offer domain-specific optimizations and abstractions that improve code readability and maintainability. However, leveraging these languages requires developers to rewrite existing code using the specific DSL's API. While large language models (LLMs) have shown some success in automatic code transpilation, none of them provide any functional correctness guarantees on the transpiled code. Another approach f...
