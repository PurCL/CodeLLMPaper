- [Can Large Language Models Transform Natural Language Intent into Formal Method Postconditions?](../venues/FSE2024/paper_9.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Informal natural language that describes code functionality, such as code comments or function documentation, may contain substantial information about a program’s intent. However, there is typically no guarantee that a program’s implementation and natural language documentation are aligned. In the case of a conflict, leveraging information in code-adjacent natural language has the potential to enhance fault localization, debugging, and code trustworthiness. In practice, however, this informatio...

- [DAInfer: Inferring API Aliasing Specifications from Library Documentation via Neurosymbolic Optimization](../venues/FSE2024/paper_28.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Modern software systems heavily rely on various libraries, necessitating understanding API semantics in static analysis. However, summarizing API semantics remains challenging due to complex implementations or the unavailability of library code. This paper presents DAInfer, a novel approach for inferring API aliasing specifications from library documentation. Specifically, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to interpret informal semantic information provided by the documentation,...

- [Enchanting program specification synthesis by large language models using static analysis and program verification](../venues/CAV2024/paper_1.md), ([CAV2024](../venues/CAV2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formal verification provides a rigorous and systematic approach to ensure the correctness and reliability of software systems. Yet, constructing specifications for the full proof relies on domain expertise and non-trivial manpower. In view of such needs, an automated approach for specification synthesis is desired. While existing automated approaches are limited in their versatility, i.e., they either focus only on synthesizing loop invariants for numerical programs, or are tailored for specific...

- [Generating API Parameter Security Rules with LLM for API Misuse Detection](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_20.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In this paper, we present a new framework, named GPTAid, for automatic APSRs generation by analyzing API source code with LLM and detecting API misuse caused by incorrect parameter use. To validate the correctness of the LLM-generated APSRs, we propose an execution feedback-checking approach based on the observation that security-critical API misuse is often caused by APSRs violations, and most of them result in runtime errors. Specifically, GPTAid first uses LLM to generate raw APSRs and the Ri...

- [Impact of large language models on generating software specifications](../venues/arXiv2023/paper_12.md), ([arXiv2023](../venues/arXiv2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Software specifications are essential for ensuring the reliability of software systems. Existing specification extraction approaches, however, suffer from limited generalizability and require manual efforts. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been successfully applied to numerous software engineering tasks, offers a promising avenue for automating this process. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs for generating so...

- [SpecEval: Evaluating Code Comprehension in Large Language Models via Program Specifications](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_26.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large Language models have achieved impressive performance in automated software engineering. Extensive efforts have been made to evaluate the abilities of code LLMs in various aspects, with an increasing number of benchmarks and evaluation frameworks proposed. Apart from the most sought-after capability of code generation, the capability of code comprehension is being granted growing attention. Nevertheless, existing works assessing the code comprehension capability of LLMs exhibit varied limit...

- [SpecGen: Automated Generation of Formal Program Specifications via Large Language Models](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_25.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In software development, formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, it is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have emerged. However, existing methods usually ...
