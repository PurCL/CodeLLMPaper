# Specification Inference

- [Can Large Language Models Transform Natural Language Intent into Formal Method Postconditions?](../venues/FSE2024/paper_9.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Informal natural language that describes code functionality, such as code comments or function documentation, may contain substantial information about a program’s intent. However, there is typically no guarantee that a program’s implementation and natural language documentation are aligned. In the ...

- [DAInfer: Inferring API Aliasing Specifications from Library Documentation via Neurosymbolic Optimization](../venues/FSE2024/paper_28.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Modern software systems heavily rely on various libraries, necessitating understanding API semantics in static analysis. However, summarizing API semantics remains challenging due to complex implementations or the unavailability of library code. This paper presents DAInfer, a novel approach for infe...

- [Enchanting program specification synthesis by large language models using static analysis and program verification](../venues/CAV2024/paper_1.md), ([CAV2024](../venues/CAV2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Formal verification provides a rigorous and systematic approach to ensure the correctness and reliability of software systems. Yet, constructing specifications for the full proof relies on domain expertise and non-trivial manpower. In view of such needs, an automated approach for specification synth...

- [Generating API Parameter Security Rules with LLM for API Misuse Detection](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_17.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In this paper, we present a new framework, named GPTAid, for automatic APSRs generation by analyzing API source code with LLM and detecting API misuse caused by incorrect parameter use. To validate the correctness of the LLM-generated APSRs, we propose an execution feedback-checking approach based o...

- [Impact of large language models on generating software specifications](../venues/arXiv2023/paper_11.md), ([arXiv2023](../venues/arXiv2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Software specifications are essential for ensuring the reliability of software systems. Existing specification extraction approaches, however, suffer from limited generalizability and require manual efforts. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been successfully applied t...

- [SpecGen: Automated Generation of Formal Program Specifications via Large Language Models](../venues/arXiv2024/paper_19.md), ([arXiv2024](../venues/arXiv2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: In software development, formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, it is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly ...
