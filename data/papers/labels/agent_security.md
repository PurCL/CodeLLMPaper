- [AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](../venues/arXiv2025/paper_17.md), ([arXiv2025](../venues/arXiv2025/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framewo...
