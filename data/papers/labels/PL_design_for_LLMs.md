- [Prompting Is Programming: A Query Language for Large Language Models](../venues/PLDI2023/paper_1.md), ([PLDI2023](../venues/PLDI2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide range of tasks such as question answering and code generation.  On a high level, given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt th...

- [Relational Programming with Foundational Models](../venues/AAAI2024/paper_2.md), ([AAAI2024](../venues/AAAI2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Foundation models have vast potential to enable diverse AI applications. The powerful yet incomplete nature of these models has spurred a wide range of mechanisms to augment them with capabilities such as in-context learning, information retrieval, and code interpreting. We propose VIEIRA, a declara...

- [Scallop: A Language for Neurosymbolic Programming](../venues/PLDI2023/paper_2.md), ([PLDI2023](../venues/PLDI2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: We present Scallop, a language which combines the benefits of deep learning and logical reasoning. Scallop enables users to write a wide range of neurosymbolic applications and train them in a data- and compute-efficient manner. It achieves these goals through three key features: 1) a flexible symbo...
