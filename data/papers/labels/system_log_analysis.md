# System Log Analysis

- [Go Static: Contextualized Logging Statement Generation](../venues/FSE2024/paper_18.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Logging practices have been extensively investigated to assist developers in writing appropriate logging statements for documenting software behaviors. Although numerous automatic logging approaches have been proposed, their performance remains unsatisfactory due to the constraint of the single-meth...

- [LILAC: Log Parsing using LLMs with Adaptive Parsing Cache](../venues/FSE2024/paper_15.md), ([FSE2024](../venues/FSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Log parsing transforms log messages into structured formats, serving as the prerequisite step for various log analysis tasks. Although a variety of log parsing approaches have been proposed, their performance on complicated log data remains compromised due to the use of human-crafted rules or learni...

- [Log Parsing with Generalization Ability under New Log Types](../venues/FSE2023/paper_10.md), ([FSE2023](../venues/FSE2023/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Log parsing, which converts semi-structured logs into structured logs, is the first step for automated log analysis.  Existing parsers are still unsatisfactory in real-world systems due to new log types in new-coming logs.  In practice, available logs collected during system runtime often do not con...

- [UniLog: Automatic Logging via LLM and In-Context Learning](../venues/ICSE2024/paper_1.md), ([ICSE2024](../venues/ICSE2024/README.md))

  - **Abstract**: Logging, which aims to determine the position of logging statements, the verbosity levels, and the log messages, is a crucial process for software reliability enhancement. In recent years, numerous automatic logging tools have been designed to assist developers in one of the logging tasks (e.g., pro...
