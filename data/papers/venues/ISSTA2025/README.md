## [Unlocking Low Frequency Syscalls in Kernel Fuzzing with Dependency-Based RAG](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Zhiyu Zhang, Longxing Li, Ruigang Liang and Kai Chen
- **Abstract**: Most coverage-guided kernel fuzzers test operating system kernels based on syscall sequence synthesis. However, there are still syscalls rarely or not covered (called low frequency syscalls, LFS) in a period of fuzzing, meaning the relevant code branches remain unexplored. This is due to the complexity dependencies of the LFS and mutation uncertainty, which makes it difficult for fuzzers to generate corresponding syscall sequences. Since many kernel fuzzers can dynamically learn syscall dependen...
