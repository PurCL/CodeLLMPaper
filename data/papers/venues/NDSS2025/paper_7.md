# From Large to Mammoth: A Comparative Evaluation of Large Language Models in Vulnerability Detection

**Authors**: Jie Lin and David Mohaisen

**Abstract**:

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in tasks such as code understanding and generation. This study evaluates several advanced LLMs—such as LLaMA-2, CodeLLaMA, LLaMA-3, Mistral, Mixtral, Gemma, CodeGemma, Phi-2, Phi-3, and GPT-4—for vulnerability detection, primarily in Java, with additional tests in C/C++ to assess generalization. We transition from basic positive sample detection to a more challenging task involving both positive and negative samples and evaluate the LLMs’ ability to identify specific vulnerability types. Performance is analyzed using runtime and detection accuracy in zero-shot and few-shot settings with custom and generic metrics. Key insights include the strong performance of models like Gemma and LLaMA-2 in identifying vulnerabilities, though this success varies, with some configurations performing no better than random guessing. Performance also fluctuates significantly across programming languages and learning modes (zero- vs. few-shot). We further investigate the impact of model parameters, quantization methods, context window (CW) sizes, and architectural choices on vulnerability detection. While CW consistently enhances performance, benefits from other parameters, such as quantization, are more limited. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in automated vulnerability detection, the complex interplay of model parameters, and the current limitations in varied scenarios and configurations.Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in tasks such as code understanding and generation.
