## [Examining Zero-Shot Vulnerability Repair with Large Language Models](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Pearce, Hammond and Tan, Benjamin and Ahmad, Baleegh and Karri, Ramesh and Dolan-Gavitt, Brendan
- **Abstract**: Human developers can produce code with cybersecurity bugs. Can emerging ‘smart’ code completion tools help repair those bugs? In this work, we examine the use of large language models (LLMs) for code (such as OpenAI’s Codex and AI21’s Jurassic J-1) for zero-shot vulnerability repair. We investigate ...
