## [CALLME: Call Graph Augmentation with Large Language Models for Javascript](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Michael Wang, Kexin Pei, Armando Solar-Lezama
- **Abstract**: Building precise call graphs for Javascript programs is a fundamental build-ing block for many important software engineering and security applications such as bug detection, program repair, and refactoring. However, resolving dynamic calls using static analysis is challenging because it requires enumerating all possible values of both the object and the field. As a result, static call graph construction algorithms for Javascript ignore such dynamic calls, resulting in missed edges and a high fa...
