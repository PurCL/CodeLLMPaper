## [E{\&}V: Prompting Large Language Models to Perform Static Analysis by Pseudo-code Execution and Verification](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Yu Hao and Weiteng Chen and Ziqiao Zhou and Weidong Cui
- **Abstract**: Static analysis, the process of examining code without executing it, is crucial for identifying software issues. Yet, static analysis is hampered by its complexity and the need for customization for different targets. Traditional static analysis tools require extensive human effort and are often limited to specific target programs and programming languages. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, offer new capabilities for software engineering tasks. However...

## [Natural Language Commanding via Program Synthesis](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Gandhi, Apurva and Nguyen, Thong Q and Jiao, Huitian and Steen, Robert and Bhatawdekar, Ameya
- **Abstract**: We present Semantic Interpreter, a natural language-friendly AI system for productivity software such as Microsoft Office that leverages large language models (LLMs) to execute user intent across application features. While LLMs are excellent at understanding user intent expressed as natural language, they are not sufficient for fulfilling application-specific user intent that requires more than text-to-text transformations. We therefore introduce the Office Domain Specific Language (ODSL), a co...
