## [Neural code comprehension: A learnable representation of code semantics](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Ben-Nun, Tal and Jakobovits, Alice Shoshana and Hoefler, Torsten
- **Abstract**: With the recent success of embeddings in natural language processing, research has been conducted into applying similar methods to code analysis. Most works attempt to process the code directly or use a syntactic tree representation, treating it like sentences written in a natural language. However, none of the existing methods are sufficient to comprehend program semantics robustly, due to structural features such as function calls, branching, and interchangeable order of statements. In this pa...
