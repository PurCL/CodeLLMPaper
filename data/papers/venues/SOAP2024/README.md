## [Interleaving Static Analysis and LLM Prompting](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Chapman, Patrick J and Rubio-Gonz{\'a}lez, Cindy and Thakur, Aditya V
- **Abstract**: This paper presents a new approach for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve static program analysis. Specifically, during program analysis, we interleave calls to the static analyzer and queries to the LLM: the prompt used to query the LLM is constructed using intermediate results from the static analysis, and the result from the LLM query is used for subsequent analysis of the program. We apply this novel approach to the problem of error-specification inference of functions in systems ...
