- **Abstract**: Reverse engineering is essential in malware analysis, vulnerability discovery, etc. Decompilers assist the reverse engineers by lifting the assembly to the high-level programming language, which highly boosts binary comprehension. However, decompilers suffer from problems such as meaningless variable names, redundant variables, and lacking comments describing the purpose of the code. Previous studies have shown promising performance in refining the decompiler output by training the models with h...

## [Large Language Model guided Protocol Fuzzing](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Ruijie Meng and Singapore) and Martin Mirchev and Marcel BÃ¶hme and Germany and Monash University and Australia) and Abhik Roychoudhury
- **Abstract**: How to find security flaws in a protocol implementation without a machine-readable specification of the protocol? Facing the internet, protocol implementations are particularly security-critical software systems where inputs must adhere to a specific structure and order that is often informally specified in hundreds of pages in natural language (RFC). Without some machine-readable version of that protocol, it is difficult to automatically generate valid test inputs for its implementation that fo...
