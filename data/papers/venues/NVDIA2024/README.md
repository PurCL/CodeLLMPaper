- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in code generation tasks. However, their code-writing abilities are often limited in scope: while they can successfully implement simple functions, they struggle with more complex tasks. A fundamental difference with how an LLM writes code, compared to a human programmer, is that it cannot consistently spot and fix bugs. Debugging is a crucial skill for programmers and it enables iterative code refinement towards a correct implementation. In this work, w...
