- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce invalid code, as they do not precisely model formal aspects of programming languages. Constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue and has been successfully applied to domain-specific languages and syntactic features, but is not able to enforce more semantic features, such as well-typedness. To address this issue, we introduce type-aware constrained decodi...
