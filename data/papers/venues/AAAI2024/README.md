## [Relational Programming with Foundational Models](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Ziyang Li and Jiani Huang and Jason Liu and Felix Zhu and Eric Zhao and William Dodds and Neelay Velingker and Rajeev Alur and Mayur Naik
- **Abstract**: Foundation models have vast potential to enable diverse AI applications. The powerful yet incomplete nature of these models has spurred a wide range of mechanisms to augment them with capabilities such as in-context learning, information retrieval, and code interpreting. We propose VIEIRA, a declarative framework that unifies these mechanisms in a general solution for programming with foundation models. VIEIRA follows a probabilistic relational paradigm and treats foundation models as stateless ...

## [When Do Program-of-Thought Works for Reasoning?](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Bi, Zhen and Zhang, Ningyu and Jiang, Yinuo and Deng, Shumin and Zheng, Guozhou and Chen, Huajun
- **Abstract**: In the realm of embodied artificial intelligence, the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role. Although there are effective methods like program-of-thought prompting for LLMs which uses programming language to tackle complex reasoning tasks, the specific impact of code data on the improvement of reasoning capabilities remains under-explored. To address this gap, we propose complexity-impacted reasoning score CIRS, which combines structural and logical attribute...
