**Abstract**:

IoT devices have significantly impacted our daily lives, and detecting vulnerabilities in embedded systems early on is critical for ensuring their security. Among the existing vulnerability detection techniques for embedded systems, static taint analysis has been proven effective in detecting severe vulnerabilities, such as command injection vulnerabilities, which can cause remote code execution. Nevertheless, static taint analysis is faced with the problem of identifying sources comprehensively and accurately.
