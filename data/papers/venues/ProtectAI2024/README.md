## [Vulnhuntr: Autonomous AI Finds First 0-Day Vulnerabilities in Wild](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Dan McInerney and Marcello Salvati
- **Abstract**: Today, we introduce [Vulnhuntr](https://github.com/protectai/vulnhuntr), a Python static code analyzer that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) to find and explain complex, multistep vulnerabilities. Thanks to the capabilities of models like Claude 3.5, AI has now uncovered more than a dozen remotely exploitable 0-day vulnerabilities targeting open-source projects in the AI ecosystem with over 10,000 GitHub stars in just a few hours of running it. These discoveries include full-b...
