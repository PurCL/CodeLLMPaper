## [Pre-train, prompt, and predict: A systematic survey of prompting methods in natural language processing](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Liu, Pengfei and Yuan, Weizhe and Fu, Jinlan and Jiang, Zhengbao and Hayashi, Hiroaki and Neubig, Graham
- **Abstract**: This article surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub “prompt-based learning.” Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, ...
