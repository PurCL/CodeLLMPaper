## [A Comprehensive Study of the Capabilities of Large Language Models for Vulnerability Detection](paper_12.md)
- **Authors**: Benjamin Steenhoek and Md Mahbubur Rahman and Monoshi Kumar Roy and Mirza Sanjida Alam and Earl T. Barr and Wei Le
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for code generation and other software engineering tasks. Vulnerability detection is of crucial importance to maintaining the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of software systems. Precise vulnerability detection requires reasoning about the code, making it a good case study for exploring the limits of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Although recent work has applied LLMs to vulnerability detection using generic prompting techniq...

## [Automatic Programming: Large Language Models and Beyond](paper_8.md)
- **Authors**: Lyu, Michael R and Ray, Baishakhi and Roychoudhury, Abhik and Tan, Shin Hwei and Thongtanunam, Patanamon
- **Abstract**: Automatic programming has seen increasing popularity due to the emergence of tools like GitHub Copilot which rely on Large Language Models (LLMs). At the same time, automatically generated code faces challenges during deployment due to concerns around quality and trust. In this article, we study automated coding in a general sense and study the concerns around code quality, security and related issues of programmer responsibility. These are key issues for organizations while deciding on the usag...

## [Codemind: A framework to challenge large language models for code reasoning](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Liu, Changshu and Zhang, Shizhuo Dylan and Ibrahimzada, Ali Reza and Jabbarvand, Reyhaneh
- **Abstract**: Solely relying on test passing to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis may result in unfair assessment or promoting models with data leakage. As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). The first two evaluate models to predict the execution output ...

## [Constrained Decoding for Secure Code Generation](paper_3.md)
- **Authors**: Fu, Yanjun and Baker, Ethan and Ding, Yu and Chen, Yizheng
- **Abstract**: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have been increasingly used by developers to boost productivity, but they often generate vulnerable code. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct. This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this...

## [Enabling Memory Safety of C Programs using LLMs](paper_10.md)
- **Authors**: Mohammed, Nausheen and Lal, Akash and Rastogi, Aseem and Roy, Subhajit and Sharma, Rahul
- **Abstract**: Memory safety violations in low-level code, written in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major sources of software vulnerabilities. One method of removing such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C dialect. Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead. This porting, however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of this technique...

- **Abstract**: How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation is an open question. Existing benchmarks demonstrate poor alignment with real-world code repositories and are insufficient to evaluate the coding abilities of LLMs. This paper proposes a new benchmark - EvoCodeBench to address the preceding problems, which has three primary advances. (1) EvoCodeBench aligns with real-world repositories in multiple dimensions, e.g., code distributions and dependency distributions. (2) EvoCodeBench of...

## [Generating API Parameter Security Rules with LLM for API Misuse Detection](paper_17.md)
- **Authors**: Liu, Jinghua and Yang, Yi and Chen, Kai and Lin, Miaoqian
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we present a new framework, named GPTAid, for automatic APSRs generation by analyzing API source code with LLM and detecting API misuse caused by incorrect parameter use. To validate the correctness of the LLM-generated APSRs, we propose an execution feedback-checking approach based on the observation that security-critical API misuse is often caused by APSRs violations, and most of them result in runtime errors. Specifically, GPTAid first uses LLM to generate raw APSRs and the Ri...

- **Authors**: Yang, Ke and Liu, Jiateng and Wu, John and Yang, Chaoqi and Fung, Yi R and Li, Sha and Huang, Zixuan and Cao, Xu and Wang, Xingyao and Wang, Yiquan and others
- **Abstract**: The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language models not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a combination of natural language and formal language (code). As a medium between humans and computers, code translates high-level goals into executable steps, featuring standard syntax, logical consistency, abstraction, and modularity. In this survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code into LLMs' training data. Speci...

## [LLM-Assisted Static Analysis for Detecting Security Vulnerabilities](paper_18.md)
- **Authors**: Li, Ziyang and Dutta, Saikat and Naik, Mayur
- **Abstract**: Software is prone to security vulnerabilities. Program analysis tools to detect them have limited effectiveness in practice due to their reliance on human labeled specifications. Large language models (or LLMs) have shown impressive code generation capabilities but they cannot do complex reasoning over code to detect such vulnerabilities especially since this task requires whole-repository analysis. We propose IRIS, a neuro-symbolic approach that systematically combines LLMs with static analysis...

## [LLMorpheus: Mutation Testing using Large Language Models](paper_23.md)
- **Authors**: Tip, Frank and Bell, Jonathan and Sch{\"a}fer, Max
- **Abstract**: In mutation testing, the quality of a test suite is evaluated by introducing faults into a program and determining whether the program's tests detect them. Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a "+" with a "-" or removing a function's body. However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a technique where a Large Languag...

## [Source Code Vulnerability Detection: Combining Code Language Models and Code Property Graphs](paper_13.md)
- **Authors**: Ruitong Liu and Yanbin Wang and Haitao Xu and Bin Liu and Jianguo Sun and Zhenhao Guo and Wenrui Ma
- **Abstract**: Currently, deep learning successfully applies to code vulnerability detection by learning from code sequences or property graphs. However, sequence-based methods often overlook essential code attributes such as syntax, control flow, and data dependencies, whereas graph-based approaches might underestimate the semantics of code and face challenges in capturing long-distance contextual information.To address this gap, we propose Vul-LMGNN, a unified model that combines pre-trained code language mo...

However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, it is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs.

## [Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities](paper_24.md)
- **Authors**: Fang, Richard and Bindu, Rohan and Gupta, Akul and Zhan, Qiusi and Kang, Daniel
- **Abstract**: LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior ...
