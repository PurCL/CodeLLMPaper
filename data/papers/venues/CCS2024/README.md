## [ReSym: Harnessing LLMs to Recover Variable and Data Structure Symbols from Stripped Binaries](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Xie, Danning and Zhang, Zhuo and Jiang, Nan and Xu, Xiangzhe and Tan, Lin and Zhang, Xiangyu
- **Abstract**: Decompilation aims to recover a binary executable to the source code form and hence has a wide range of applications in cyber security, such as malware analysis and legacy code hardening. A prominent challenge is to recover variable symbols, including both primitive and complex types such as user-defined data structures, along with their symbol information such as names and types. Existing efforts focus on solving parts of the problem, eg, recovering only types (without names) or only local vari...
