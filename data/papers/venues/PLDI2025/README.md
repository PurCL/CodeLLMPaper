## [DR.FIX: Automatically Fixing Data Races at Industry Scale](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Farnaz Behrang, Zhizhou Zhang, Georgian-Vlad Saioc, Peng Liu, Milind Chabbi
- **Abstract**: Data races are a prevalent class of concurrency bugs in shared-memory parallel programs, posing significant challenges to software reliability and reproducibility. While there is an extensive body of research on detecting data races and a wealth of practical detection tools across various programming languages, considerably less effort has been directed toward automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. In large codebases, data races are continuously introduced and exhibit myriad pat...
