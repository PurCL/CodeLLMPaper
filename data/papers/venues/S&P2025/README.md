## [Codebreaker: Dynamic Extraction Attacks on Code Language Models](paper_4.md)
- **Authors**: Han, Changzhou and Deng, Zehang and Ma, Wanlun and Zhu, Xiaogang and Xue, Minhui and Zhu, Tianqing and Wen, Sheng and Xiang, Yang
- **Abstract**: With the rapid adoption of LLM-based code assistants to enhance programming experiences, concerns over extraction attacks targeting private training data have intensified. These attacks specifically aim to extract Personal Information (PI) embedded within the training data of code generation models (CodeLLMs). Existing methods, using either manual or semi-automated techniques, have successfully extracted sensitive data from these CodeLLMs. However, the limited amount of data currently retrieved ...

## [Make a Feint to the East While Attacking in the West: Blinding LLM-Based Code Auditors with Flashboom Attacks](paper_5.md)
- **Authors**: Li, Xiao and Li, Yue and Wu, Hao and Zhang, Yue and Xu, Kaidi and Cheng, Xiuzhen and Zhong, Sheng and Xu, Fengyuan
- **Abstract**: LLM-based vulnerability auditors (e.g., GitHub Copilot) represent a significant advancement in automated code analysis, offering precise detection of security vulnerabilities. This paper explores the potential to circumvent LLM-based vulnerability auditors by diverting their focus, decided by the LLM attention mechanism, away from real vulnerable code segments. In these LLM-based vulnerability auditors, the attention mechanism is supposed to focus on potentially vulnerable code sections to ident...

## [My Model is Malware to You: Transforming AI Models into Malware by Abusing TensorFlow APIs](paper_3.md)
- **Authors**: Zhu, Ruofan and Chen, Ganhao and Shen, Wenbo and Xie, Xiaofei and Chang, Rui
- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the demand for AI models across various industries. While model sharing reduces costs and fosters innovation, it also introduces security risks, as attackers can embed malicious code within models, leading to potential undetected attacks when running the model. Despite these risks, the security of model sharing, particularly for TensorFlow, remains under-investigated. To address these security concerns, we present a systematic ...

## [SV-TrustEval-C: Evaluating Structure and Semantic Reasoning in Large Language Models for Source Code Vulnerability Analysis](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Li, Yansong and Branco, Paula and Hoole, Alexander M. and Marwah, Manish and Koduvely, Hari Manassery and Jourdan, Guy-Vincent and Jou, Stephan
- **Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve in understanding and generating code, accurately evaluating their reliability in analyzing source code vulnerabilities becomes in-creasingly vital. While studies have examined LLM capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often over-look the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce SV-TRUSTEVAL-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abil...

## [TypeForge: Synthesizing and Selecting Best-Fit Composite Data Types for Stripped Binaries](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Wang, Yanzhong and Liang, Ruigang and Li, Yilin and Hu, Peiwei and Chen, Kai and Zhang, Bolun
- **Abstract**: Static binary analysis is a widely used approach for ensuring the security of closed-source software. However, the absence of type information in stripped binaries, particularly for composite data types, poses significant challenges for both static analyzers and reverse engineering experts in achieving efficient and accurate analysis. Existing methods often struggle with inaccuracies and scalability limitations when dealing with such data types. To address these problems, we present Typeforge, a...
