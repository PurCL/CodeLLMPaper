## [Unifying the perspectives of nlp and software engineering: A survey on language models for code](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Zhang, Ziyin and Chen, Chaoyu and Liu, Bingchang and Liao, Cong and Gong, Zi and Yu, Hang and Li, Jianguo and Wang, Rui
- **Abstract**: In this work we systematically review the recent advancements in software engineering with language models, covering 70+ models, 40+ evaluation tasks, 180+ datasets, and 900 related works. Unlike previous works, we integrate software engineering (SE) with natural language processing (NLP) by discussing the perspectives of both sides: SE applies language models for development automation, while NLP...
