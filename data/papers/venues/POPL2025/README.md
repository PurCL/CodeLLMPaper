- **Abstract**: Recently, the rise of code-centric large language models (LLMs) appears to have reshaped the software engineering world with low-barrier tools like Copilot that can generate code easily. However, there is no correctness guarantee for the code generated by LLMs, which suffer from the hallucination pr...
