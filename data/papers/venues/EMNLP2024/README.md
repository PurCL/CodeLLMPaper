## [AMR-Evol: Adaptive Modular Response Evolution Elicits Better Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models in Code Generation](paper_17.md)
- **Authors**: Luo, Ziyang and Li, Xin and Lin, Hongzhan and Ma, Jing and Bing, Lidong
- **Abstract**: The impressive performance of proprietary LLMs like GPT4 in code generation has led to a trend to replicate these capabilities in open-source models through knowledge distillation (e.g. Code Evol-Instruct). However, these efforts often neglect the crucial aspect of response quality, relying heavily on teacher models for direct response distillation. This paradigm, especially for complex instructions, can degrade the quality of synthesized data, compromising the knowledge distillation process. To...

## [Can LLMs Reason in the Wild with Programs?](paper_11.md)
- **Authors**: Yang, Yuan and Xiong, Siheng and Payani, Ali and Shareghi, Ehsan and Fekri, Faramarz
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown superior capability to solve reasoning problems with programs. While being a promising direction, most of such frameworks are trained and evaluated in settings with a prior knowledge of task requirements. However, as LLMs become more capable, it is necessary to assess their reasoning abilities in more realistic scenarios where many real-world problems are open-ended with ambiguous scope, and often require multiple formalisms to solve. To investigate this, ...

## [Code Prompting Elicits Conditional Reasoning Abilities in Text+Code LLMs](paper_25.md)
- **Authors**: Puerto, Haritz and Tutek, Martin and Aditya, Somak and Zhu, Xiaodan and Gurevych, Iryna
- **Abstract**: Reasoning is a fundamental component of language understanding. Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs’ performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the input representation on the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We hypothesize that representing natural language tasks as code can enhance specific...

## [Rethinking Code Refinement: Learning to Judge Code Efficiency](paper_12.md)
- **Authors**: Seo, Minju and Baek, Jinheon and Hwang, Sung Ju
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating codes. Due to these capabilities, many recent methods are proposed to automatically refine the codes with LLMs. However, we should rethink that the refined codes (from LLMs and even humans) are not always more efficient than their original versions. On the other hand, running two different versions of codes and comparing them every time is not ideal and time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, ...

## [Revisiting the Impact of Pursuing Modularity for Code Generation](paper_13.md)
- **Authors**: Kang, Deokyeong and Seo, KiJung and Kim, Taeuk
- **Abstract**: Modular programming, which aims to construct the final program by integrating smaller, independent building blocks, has been regarded as a desirable practice in software development. However, with the rise of recent code generation agents built upon large language models (LLMs), a question emerges: is this traditional practice equally effective for these new tools? In this work, we assess the impact of modularity in code generation by introducing a novel metric for its quantitative measurement. ...

## [Sanitizing Large Language Models in Bug Detection with Data-Flow](paper_4.md)
- **Authors**: Wang, Chengpeng and Zhang, Wuqi and Su, Zian and Xu, Xiangzhe and Zhang, Xiangyu
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) show potential in code reasoning tasks, facilitating the customization of detecting bugs in software development. However, the hallucination effect can significantly compromise the reliability of bug reports. This work formulates a new schema of bug detection and presents a novel sanitization technique that detects false positives for hallucination mitigation. Our key idea is to enforce LLMs to emit data-flow paths in few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and validate ...

## [Self-Constructed Context Decompilation with Fined-grained Alignment Enhancement](paper_7.md)
- **Authors**: Feng, Yunlong and Teng, Dechuan and Xu, Yang and Mu, Honglin and Xu, Xiao and Qin, Libo and Zhu, Qingfu and Che, Wanxiang
- **Abstract**: Decompilation transforms compiled code back into a high-level programming language for analysis when source code is unavailable. Previous work has primarily focused on enhancing decompilation performance by increasing the scale of model parameters or training data for pre-training. Based on the characteristics of the decompilation task, we propose two methods: (1) Without fine-tuning, the Self-Constructed Context Decompilation (sc²dec) method recompiles the LLM’s decompilation results to constru...

- **Authors**: Chidambaram, Subramanian and Li, Li Erran and Bai, Min and Li, Xiaopeng and Lin, Kaixiang and Zhou, Xiong and Williams, Alex C.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for generating code solutions, empowered by features like self-debugging and self-reflection. However, LLMs often struggle with complex programming problems without human guidance. This paper investigates the strategies employed by expert programmers to steer code-generating LLMs toward successful outcomes. Through a study involving experts using natural language to guide GPT-4, Gemini Ultra, and, Claude 3.5 Sonnet on highly difficult programmin...

## [Stanceformer: Target-Aware Transformer for Stance Detection](paper_5.md)
- **Authors**: Garg, Krishna and Caragea, Cornelia
- **Abstract**: The task of Stance Detection involves discerning the stance expressed in a text towards a specific subject or target. Prior works have relied on existing transformer models that lack the capability to prioritize targets effectively. Consequently, these models yield similar performance regardless of whether we utilize or disregard target information, undermining the task’s significance. To address this challenge, we introduce Stanceformer, a target-aware transformer model that incorporates enhanc...

## [TransLLaMa: LLM-based Simultaneous Translation System](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Koshkin, Roman and Sudoh, Katsuhito and Nakamura, Satoshi
- **Abstract**: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in text generation and reasoning. Nonetheless, they have limited applications in simultaneous machine translation (SiMT), currently dominated by encoder-decoder transformers. This study demonstrates that, after fine-tuning on a small dataset comprising causally aligned source and target sentence pairs, a pre-trained open-source LLM can control input segmentation directly by generating a special “wait” to...
