# PythonSaga: Redefining the Benchmark to Evaluate Code Generating LLMs

**Authors**: Yadav, Ankit and Beniwal, Himanshu and Singh, Mayank

**Abstract**:

Driven by the surge in code generation using large language models (LLMs), numerous benchmarks have emerged to evaluate these LLMs capabilities. We conducted a large-scale human evaluation of *HumanEval* and *MBPP*, two popular benchmarks for Python code generation, analyzing their diversity and difficulty. Our findings unveil a critical bias towards a limited set of programming concepts, neglecting most of the other concepts entirely. Furthermore, we uncover a worrying prevalence of easy tasks that can inflate model performance estimations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel benchmark, *PythonSaga*, featuring 185 hand-crafted prompts in a balanced representation of 38 programming concepts across diverse difficulty levels. The robustness of our benchmark is demonstrated by the poor performance of existing Code-LLMs. The code and data set are openly available to the NLP community at this [URL](https://github.com/PythonSaga/PythonSaga).
