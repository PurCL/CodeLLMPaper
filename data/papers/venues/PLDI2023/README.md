## [Prompting Is Programming: A Query Language for Large Language Models](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Beurer-Kellner, Luca and Fischer, Marc and Vechev, Martin
- **Abstract**: Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide range of tasks such as question answering and code generation.  On a high level, given an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the sequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these models with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of downstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between the language model, a user, and external to...

## [Scallop: A Language for Neurosymbolic Programming](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Li, Ziyang and Huang, Jiani and Naik, Mayur
- **Abstract**: We present Scallop, a language which combines the benefits of deep learning and logical reasoning. Scallop enables users to write a wide range of neurosymbolic applications and train them in a data- and compute-efficient manner. It achieves these goals through three key features: 1) a flexible symbolic representation that is based on the relational data model; 2) a declarative logic programming language that is based on Datalog and supports recursion, aggregation, and negation; and 3) a framewor...
