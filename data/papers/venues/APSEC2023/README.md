- **Authors**: Shirafuji, Atsushi and Oda, Yusuke and Suzuki, Jun and Morishita, Makoto and Watanobe, Yutaka
- **Abstract**: A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user...
