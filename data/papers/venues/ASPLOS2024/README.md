## [The Mutators Reloaded: Fuzzing Compilers with Large Language Model Generated Mutation Operators](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Ou, Xianfei and Li, Cong and Jiang, Yanyan and Xu, Chang
- **Abstract**: Crafting high-quality mutators–the core of mutation-based fuzzing that shapes the search space–is challenging. It requires human expertise and creativity, and their implementation demands knowledge of compiler internals. This paper presents MetaMut framework for developing new, useful mutators for c...
