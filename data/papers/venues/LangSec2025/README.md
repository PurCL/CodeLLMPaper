## [Large Language Models for Validating Network Protocol Parsers](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Mingwei Zheng, Danning Xie, Xiangyu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Network protocol parsers are essential for enabling correct and secure communication between devices. Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical vulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and denial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to compare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this comparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in natural language, whereas implementations are i...
