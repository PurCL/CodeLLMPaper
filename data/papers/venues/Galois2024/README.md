## [Function Argument Nullability Using an LLM](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Galois
- **Abstract**: We think that Rust is a great language, and maybe you agree! Unfortunately, even if you do, there’s a good chance whatever application you’re working on is written in some older language such as C. To help with this, Galois has been developing c2rust, an automated transpiler (source-to-source translator) from C code into Rust code. c2rust can take almost any C and turn it into C-like Rust code, the first step in creating a new Rust application. And we’re building more features to turn C into saf...
