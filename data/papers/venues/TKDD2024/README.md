- **Abstract**: Static analysis tools for capturing bugs and vulnerabilities in software programs are widely employed in practice, as they have the unique advantages of high coverage and independence from the execution environment. However, existing tools for analyzing large codebases often produce a great deal of false warnings over genuine bug reports. As a result, developers are required to manually inspect and confirm each warning, a challenging, time-consuming, and automation-essential task.
