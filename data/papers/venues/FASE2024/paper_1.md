# Can ChatGPT support software verification?

**Authors**: Jan{\ss}en, Christian and Richter, Cedric and Wehrheim, Heike

**Abstract**:

Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification.
