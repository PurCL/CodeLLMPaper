- **Authors**: Yizheng Chen and Zhoujie Ding and Lamya Alowain and Xinyun Chen and David A. Wagner
- **Abstract**: We propose and release a new vulnerable source code dataset. We curate the dataset by crawling security issue websites, extracting vulnerability-fixing commits and source codes from the corresponding projects. Our new dataset contains 18,945 vulnerable functions spanning 150 CWEs and 330,492 non-vulnerable functions extracted from 7,514 commits. Our dataset covers 295 more projects than all previous datasets combined.Combining our new dataset with previous datasets, we present an analysis of the...
