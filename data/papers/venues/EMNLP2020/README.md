## [Codebert: A pre-trained model for programming and natural languages](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Feng, Zhangyin and Guo, Daya and Tang, Duyu and Duan, Nan and Feng, Xiaocheng and Gong, Ming and Shou, Linjun and Qin, Bing and Liu, Ting and Jiang, Daxin and others
- **Abstract**: We present CodeBERT, a bimodal pre-trained model for programming language (PL) and nat-ural language (NL). CodeBERT learns general-purpose representations that support downstream NL-PL applications such as natural language codesearch, code documentation generation, etc. We develop CodeBERT with Transformer-based neural architecture, and train it with a hybrid objective function that incorporates the pre-training task of replaced token detection, which is to detect plausible alternatives sampled ...
