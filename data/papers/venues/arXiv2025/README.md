## [AI Software Engineer: Programming with Trust](paper_3.md)
- **Authors**: Abhik Roychoudhury, Corina Pasareanu, Michael Pradel, Baishakhi Ray
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising proficiency in generating code snippets, promising to automate large parts of software engineering via artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis...

## [C2SaferRust: Transforming C Projects into Safer Rust with NeuroSymbolic Techniques](paper_5.md)
- **Authors**: Vikram Nitin, Rahul Krishna, Luiz Lemos do Valle, Baishakhi Ray
- **Abstract**: In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in converting C code to Rust, to benefit from the memory and thread safety guarantees of Rust. C2Rust is a rule-based system that can automatically convert C code to functionally identical Rust, but the Rust code that it produces is non-idiomatic, i.e., makes extensive use of unsafe Rust, a subset of the language that doesn't have memory or thread safety guarantees. At the other end of the spectrum are LLMs, which produce idiomatic Rust code, but...

## [Hierarchical Repository-Level Code Summarization for Business Applications Using Local LLMs](paper_4.md)
- **Authors**: Nilesh Dhulshette, Sapan Shah, Vinay Kulkarni
- **Abstract**: In large-scale software development, understanding the functionality and intent behind complex codebases is critical for effective development and maintenance. While code summarization has been widely studied, existing methods primarily focus on smaller code units, such as functions, and struggle with larger code artifacts like files and packages. Additionally, current summarization models tend to emphasize low-level implementation details, often overlooking the domain and business context that ...

## [LAMD: Context-driven Android Malware Detection and Classification with LLMs](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Xingzhi Qian, Xinran Zheng, Yiling He, Shuo Yang, Lorenzo Cavallaro
- **Abstract**: The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of class...

## [Language Models for Code Optimization: Survey, Challenges and Future Directions](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Jingzhi Gong, Vardan Voskanyan, Paul Brookes, Fan Wu, Wei Jie, Jie Xu, Rafail Giavrimis, Mike Basios, Leslie Kanthan, Zheng Wang
- **Abstract**: Language models (LMs) built upon deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated breakthrough effectiveness in software engineering tasks such as code generation, completion, and repair. This has paved the way for the emergence of LM-based code optimization techniques, which are crucial for enhancing the performance of existing programs, such as accelerating program execution time. However, a comprehensive survey dedicated to this specific application has been lacking. To fill this gap, w...
