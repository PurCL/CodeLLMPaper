## [AI Software Engineer: Programming with Trust](paper_6.md)
- **Authors**: Abhik Roychoudhury, Corina Pasareanu, Michael Pradel, Baishakhi Ray
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising proficiency in generating code snippets, promising to automate large parts of software engineering via artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis...

## [ClassInvGen: Class Invariant Synthesis using Large Language Models](paper_5.md)
- **Authors**: Chuyue Sun, Viraj Agashe, Saikat Chakraborty, Jubi Taneja, Clark Barrett, David Dill, Xiaokang Qiu, Shuvendu K. Lahiri
- **Abstract**: Formal program specifications in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants have several benefits for the construction and maintenance of programs. They not only aid in program understanding due to their unambiguous semantics but can also be enforced dynamically (or even statically when the language supports a formal verifier). However, synthesizing high-quality specifications in an underlying programming language is limited by the expressivity of the specifications or the n...

## [Combining Large Language Models with Static Analyzers for Code Review Generation](paper_4.md)
- **Authors**: Rohit Gheyi, Marcio Ribeiro, Jonhnanthan Oliveira
- **Abstract**: Code review is a crucial but often complex, subjective, and time-consuming activity in software development. Over the past decades, significant efforts have been made to automate this process. Early approaches focused on knowledge-based systems (KBS) that apply rule-based mechanisms to detect code issues, providing precise feedback but struggling with complex, context-dependent cases. More recent work has shifted toward fine-tuning pre-trained language models for code review, enabling broader is...

## [Evaluating the Effectiveness of Small Language Models in Detecting Refactoring Bugs](paper_3.md)
- **Authors**: Rohit Gheyi, Marcio Ribeiro, Jonhnanthan Oliveira
- **Abstract**: Popular IDEs frequently contain bugs in their refactoring implementations. Ensuring that a transformation preserves a program's behavior is a complex task. Traditional detection methods rely on predefined preconditions for each refactoring type, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new transformations. These methods often require extensive static and dynamic analyses, which are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and may still fail to detect certain refactoring bugs. This study ...

## [Hierarchical Repository-Level Code Summarization for Business Applications Using Local LLMs](paper_7.md)
- **Authors**: Nilesh Dhulshette, Sapan Shah, Vinay Kulkarni
- **Abstract**: In large-scale software development, understanding the functionality and intent behind complex codebases is critical for effective development and maintenance. While code summarization has been widely studied, existing methods primarily focus on smaller code units, such as functions, and struggle with larger code artifacts like files and packages. Additionally, current summarization models tend to emphasize low-level implementation details, often overlooking the domain and business context that ...

## [LAMD: Context-driven Android Malware Detection and Classification with LLMs](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Xingzhi Qian, Xinran Zheng, Yiling He, Shuo Yang, Lorenzo Cavallaro
- **Abstract**: The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of class...

## [Language Models for Code Optimization: Survey, Challenges and Future Directions](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Jingzhi Gong, Vardan Voskanyan, Paul Brookes, Fan Wu, Wei Jie, Jie Xu, Rafail Giavrimis, Mike Basios, Leslie Kanthan, Zheng Wang
- **Abstract**: Language models (LMs) built upon deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated breakthrough effectiveness in software engineering tasks such as code generation, completion, and repair. This has paved the way for the emergence of LM-based code optimization techniques, which are crucial for enhancing the performance of existing programs, such as accelerating program execution time. However, a comprehensive survey dedicated to this specific application has been lacking. To fill this gap, w...
