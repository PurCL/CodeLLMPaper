## [Hierarchical Repository-Level Code Summarization for Business Applications Using Local LLMs](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Nilesh Dhulshette, Sapan Shah, Vinay Kulkarni
- **Abstract**: In large-scale software development, understanding the functionality and intent behind complex codebases is critical for effective development and maintenance. While code summarization has been widely studied, existing methods primarily focus on smaller code units, such as functions, and struggle with larger code artifacts like files and packages. Additionally, current summarization models tend to emphasize low-level implementation details, often overlooking the domain and business context that ...

## [Language Models for Code Optimization: Survey, Challenges and Future Directions](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Jingzhi Gong, Vardan Voskanyan, Paul Brookes, Fan Wu, Wei Jie, Jie Xu, Rafail Giavrimis, Mike Basios, Leslie Kanthan, Zheng Wang
- **Abstract**: Language models (LMs) built upon deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated breakthrough effectiveness in software engineering tasks such as code generation, completion, and repair. This has paved the way for the emergence of LM-based code optimization techniques, which are crucial for enhancing the performance of existing programs, such as accelerating program execution time. However, a comprehensive survey dedicated to this specific application has been lacking. To fill this gap, w...
