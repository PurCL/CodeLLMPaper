**Abstract**:

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a notable success within generative AI. Despite this progress, many challenges remain before automated software engineering can reach its full potential. This paper presents a structured taxonomy of AI-for-SE tasks beyond code generation, identifies key technical bottlenecks limiting current approaches, and outlines promising research directions toward higher levels of automation in software engineering.
