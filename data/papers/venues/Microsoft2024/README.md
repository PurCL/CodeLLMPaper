## [Steering Large Language Models between Code Execution and Textual Reasoning](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Chen, Yongchao and Jhamtani, Harsh and Sharma, Srinagesh and Fan, Chuchu and Wang, Chi
- **Abstract**: While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is ...
