## [Who Judges the Judge: An Empirical Study on Online Judge Tests](paper_1.md)
- **Authors**: Liu, Kaibo and Han, Yudong and Zhang, Jie M. and Chen, Zhenpeng and Sarro, Federica and Harman, Mark and Huang, Gang and Ma, Yun
- **Abstract**: Online Judge platforms play a pivotal role in education, competitive programming, recruitment, career training, and large language model training. They rely on predefined test suites to judge the correctness of submitted solutions. It is therefore important that the solution judgement is reliable an...

## [Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Fuzzers: Fuzzing Deep-Learning Libraries via Large Language Models](paper_2.md)
- **Authors**: Deng, Yinlin and Xia, Chunqiu Steven and Peng, Haoran and Yang, Chenyuan and Zhang, Lingming
- **Abstract**: Deep Learning (DL) systems have received exponential growth in popularity and have become ubiquitous in our everyday life. Such systems are built on top of popular DL libraries, e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch which provide APIs as building blocks for DL systems. Detecting bugs in these DL libraries is...

## [How Effective Are Neural Networks for Fixing Security Vulnerabilities](paper_3.md)
- **Authors**: Wu, Yi and Jiang, Nan and Pham, Hung Viet and Lutellier, Thibaud and Davis, Jordan and Tan, Lin and Babkin, Petr and Shah, Sameena
- **Abstract**: Security vulnerability repair is a difficult task that is in dire need of automation. Two groups of techniques have shown promise: (1) large code language models (LLMs) that have been pre-trained on source code for tasks such as code completion, and (2) automated program repair (APR) techniques that...

## [Beware of the unexpected: Bimodal taint analysis](paper_4.md)
- **Authors**: Chow, Yiu Wai and Sch{\"a}fer, Max and Pradel, Michael
- **Abstract**: Static analysis is a powerful tool for detecting security vulnerabilities and other programming problems. Global taint tracking, in particular, can spot vulnerabilities arising from complicated data flow across multiple functions. However, precisely identifying which flows are problematic is challen...

## [Improving Binary Code Similarity Transformer Models by Semantics-Driven Instruction Deemphasis](paper_5.md)
- **Authors**: Xu, Xiangzhe and Feng, Shiwei and Ye, Yapeng and Shen, Guangyu and Su, Zian and Cheng, Siyuan and Tao, Guanhong and Shi, Qingkai and Zhang, Zhuo and Zhang, Xiangyu
- **Abstract**: Given a function in the binary executable form, binary code similarity analysis determines a set of similar functions from a large pool of candidate functions. These similar functions are usually compiled from the same source code with different compilation setups. Such analysis has a large number o...
